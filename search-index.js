Daniel Herrera Last updated: May 22th, 2023 This project showcases the integration of dbt with Teradata Vantage from an advanced user perspective. If you are new to data engineering with dbt we recommend that you start with our introductory project. The advanced use cases showcased in the demo are the following: Incremental materializations Utility macros Optimizing table/view creations with Teradata-specific modifiers The application of these concepts is illustrated through the ELT process of teddy_retailers, a fictional store. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10 installed. A database client for running database commands, an example of the configuration of one such client is presented in this tutorial.. Clone the tutorial repository and cd into the project directory: git clone https://github.com/Teradata/teddy_retailers_dbt-dev teddy_retailers cd teddy_retailers Create a new python environment to manage dbt and its dependencies. Activate the environment: python3 -m venv env source env/bin/activate Install the dbt-teradata module. The core dbt module is included as a dependency so you don’t have to install it separately: pip install dbt-teradata Install the project’s dependencies dbt-utils and teradata-utils. This can be done through the following command: dbt deps The demo project assumes that the source data is already loaded into your data warehouse, this mimics the way that dbt is used in a production environment. To achieve this objective we provide public datasets available in Google Cload Platform (GCP), and scripts to load those datasets into your mock data warehouse. Create or select a working database. The dbt profile in the project points to a database called teddy_retailers. You can change the schema value to point to an existing database in your Teradata Vantage instance or you can create the teddy_retailers database running the following script in your database client: CREATE DATABASE teddy_retailers AS PERMANENT = 110e6, SPOOL = 220e6; Load Initial data set. To load the initial data set into the data warehouse, the required scripts are available in the references/inserts/create_data.sql path of the project. You can execute these scripts by copying and pasting them into your database client. For guidance on running these scripts in your specific case please consult your database client’s documentation. We will now configure dbt to connect to your Vantage database. Create the file $HOME/.dbt/profiles.yml with the following content. Adjust , , to match your Teradata Vantage instance. If you have already used dbt before in your environment you only need to add a profile for the project in your profiles.yml file. teddy_retailers: outputs: dev: type: teradata host: user: password: logmech: TD2 schema: teddy_retailers tmode: ANSI threads: 1 timeout_seconds: 300 priority: interactive retries: 1 target: dev Now, that we have the profile file in place, we can validate the setup: dbt debug If the debug command returned errors, you likely have an issue with the content of profiles.yml. As mentioned, teddy_retailers is a fictional store. Through dbt driven transformations we transform source data ingested from the`teddy_retailers` transactional database into a star schema ready for analytics. The source data consists of the following tables customers, orders, products, and order_products, according to the following Entity Relations Diagram: Using dbt, we leverage the source data tables to construct the following dimensional model, which is optimized for analytics tools. For Teddy Retailers, the orders and order_products sources are periodically updated by the organization’s ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process. The updated data only includes the latest changes rather than the entire dataset due to its large volume. To address this challenge, it is necessary to capture these incremental updates while preserving the previously available data. The schema.yml file in the project’s models directory specifies the sources for our models. These sources align with the data we loaded from GCP using our SQL scripts. The staging area models are merely ingesting the data from each of the sources and renaming each field, if appropiate. In the schema.yml of this directory we define basic integrity checks for the primary keys. The following advanced dbt concepts are applied in the models at this stage: The schema.yml file in this directory specifies that the materializations of the two models we are building are incremental. We employ different strategies for these models: For the all_orders model, we utilize the delete+insert strategy. This strategy is implemented because there may be changes in the status of an order that are included in the data updates. For the all_order_products model, we employ the default append strategy. This approach is chosen because the same combination of order_id and product_id may appear multiple times in the sources. This indicates that a new quantity of the same product has been added or removed from a specific order. Within the all_order_products model, we have included an assertion with the help of a macro to test and guarantee that the resulting model encompasses a unique combination of order_id and product_id. This combination denotes the latest quantity of products of a specific type per order. For both the all_order and all_order_products models, we have incorporated Teradata Modifiers to enhance tracking of these two core models. To facilitate collecting statistics, we have added a post_hook that instructs the database connector accordingly. Additionally, we have created an index on the order_id column within the all_orders table. By executing dbt, we generate the dimensional model using the baseline data. dbt run This will create both our core and dimensional models using the baseline data. We can run our defined test by executing: dbt test You can find sample business intelligence queries in the references/query path of the project. These queries allow you to analyze the factual data based on dimensions such as customers, orders, and products. The scripts for loading updates into the source data set can be found in the references/inserts/update_data.sql path of the project. After updating the data sources, you can proceed with the aforementioned steps: running dbt, testing the data, and executing sample queries. This will allow you to visualize the variations and incremental updates in the data. In this tutorial, we explored the utilization of advanced dbt concepts with Teradata Vantage. The sample project showcased the transformation of source data into a dimensional data mart. Throughout the project, we implemented several advanced dbt concepts, including incremental materializations, utility macros, and Teradata modifiers. Contact us in our community.

These datasets are located on external S3-compatible object storage such as AWS S3, Google GCS, Azure Blob or on-prem implementations. It’s useful in scenarios where you want to explore data without building a data pipeline to bring it into Vantage. This tutorial demonstrates how to export data from Vantage to object storage using the Parquet file format. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. NOS is enabled in all Vantage editions from Vantage Express through Developer, DYI to Vantage as a Service starting from version 17.10. This tutorial is based on s3 aws object storage. You will need your own s3 bucket with write permissions to complete the tutorial. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. WRITE_NOS allows you to extract selected or all columns from a database table or from derived results and write to external object storage, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Google Cloud Storage. This functionality stores data in Parquet format. You can find more documentation about WRITE_NOS functionality in the NOS documentation. You will need access to a database where you can execute WRITE_NOS function. If you don’t have such a database, run the following commands: CREATE USER db AS PERM=10e7, PASSWORD=db; -- Don't forget to give the proper access rights GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION on TD_SYSFNLIB.READ_NOS to db; GRANT EXECUTE FUNCTION on TD_SYSFNLIB.WRITE_NOS to db; If you would like to learn more about setting up users and their privileges, checkout the NOS documentation. Let’s first create a table on your Teradata Vantage instance: CREATE SET TABLE db.parquet_table ,FALLBACK , NO BEFORE JOURNAL, NO AFTER JOURNAL, CHECKSUM = DEFAULT, DEFAULT MERGEBLOCKRATIO, MAP = TD_MAP1 ( column1 SMALLINT NOT NULL, column2 DATE FORMAT 'YY/MM/DD' NOT NULL, column3 DECIMAL(10,2)) PRIMARY INDEX ( column1 ); Populate your table with example data: INSERT INTO db.parquet_table (1,'2022/01/01',1.1); INSERT INTO db.parquet_table (2,'2022/01/02',2.2); INSERT INTO db.parquet_table (3,'2022/01/03',3.3); Your table should now look like this: column1 column2 column3 ------- -------- ------------ 1 22/01/01 1.10 2 22/01/02 2.20 3 22/01/03 3.30 Create the parquet file with WRITE_NOS. Don’t forget to replace with the name of your s3 bucket. Also,replace and with your access key and secret. Check your cloud provider docs how to create credentials to access object storage. For example, for AWS check out How do I create an AWS access key? SELECT * FROM WRITE_NOS ( ON ( SELECT * FROM db.parquet_table) USING LOCATION('/s3/.s3.amazonaws.com/parquet_file_on_NOS.parquet') AUTHORIZATION('{\"ACCESS_ID\":\"\", \"ACCESS_KEY\":\"\"}') STOREDAS('PARQUET') MAXOBJECTSIZE('16MB') COMPRESSION('SNAPPY') INCLUDE_ORDERING('TRUE') INCLUDE_HASHBY('TRUE') ) as d; Now you have created a parquet file in your object storage bucket. Now to easily query your file you need to follow step number 4. Create a NOS-backed foreign table. Don’t forget to replace with the name of your s3 bucket. Also,replace and with your access key and secret: CREATE MULTISET FOREIGN TABLE db.parquet_table_to_read_file_on_NOS , EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER TRUSTED CEPH_AUTH, MAP = TD_MAP1 ( Location VARCHAR(2048) CHARACTER SET UNICODE CASESPECIFIC , col1 SMALLINT , col2 DATE , col3 DECIMAL(10,2) ) USING ( LOCATION ('/s3/.s3.amazonaws.com/parquet_file_on_NOS.parquet') AUTHORIZATION('{\"ACCESS_ID\":\"\", \"ACCESS_KEY\":\"\"}') STOREDAS ('PARQUET') )NO PRIMARY INDEX; Now you are ready to Query your parquet file on NOS, let’s try the following query: SELECT col1, col2, col3 FROM db.parquet_table_to_read_file_on_NOS; The data returned from the query should look something like this: col1 col2 col3 ------ -------- ------------ 1 22/01/01 1.10 2 22/01/02 2.20 3 22/01/03 3.30 In this tutorial we have learned how to export data from Vantage to a parquet file on object storage using Native Object Storage (NOS).

Create file $HOME/.dbt/profiles.yml with the following content. Adjust , , to match your Teradata instance. Database setup The following dbt profile points to a database called jaffle_shop. You can change schema value to point to an existing database in your Teradata Vantage instance or you can create jaffle_shop database: CREATE DATABASE jaffle_shop AS PERMANENT = 110e6, SPOOL = 220e6; jaffle_shop: outputs: dev: type: teradata host: user: password: logmech: TD2 schema: jaffle_shop tmode: ANSI threads: 1 timeout_seconds: 300 priority: interactive retries: 1 target: dev Now, that we have the profile file in place, we can validate the setup: dbt debug If the debug command returned errors, you likely have an issue with the content of profiles.yml. jaffle_shop is a fictional e-commerce store. This dbt project transforms raw data from an app database into a dimensional model with customer and order data ready for analytics. The raw data from the app consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the following entity-relationship diagram: dbt takes these raw data table and builds the following dimensional model, which is more suitable for analytics tools: In real life, we will be getting raw data from platforms like Segment, Stitch, Fivetran or another ETL tool. In our case, we will use dbt’s seed functionality to create tables from csv files. The csv files are located in ./data directory. Each csv file will produce one table. dbt will inspect the files and do type inference to decide what data types to use for columns. Let’s create the raw data tables: dbt seed You should now see 3 tables in your jaffle_shop database: raw_customers, raw_orders, raw_payments. The tables should be populated with data from the csv files. Now that we have the raw tables, we can instruct dbt to create the dimensional model: dbt run So what exactly happened here? dbt created additional tables using CREATE TABLE/VIEW FROM SELECT SQL. In the first transformation, dbt took raw tables and built denormalized join tables called customer_orders, order_payments, customer_payments. You will find the definitions of these tables in ./marts/core/intermediate. In the second step, dbt created dim_customers and fct_orders tables. These are the dimensional model tables that we want to expose to our BI tool. dbt applied multiple transformations to our data. How can we ensure that the data in the dimensional model is correct? dbt allows us to define and execute tests against the data. The tests are defined in ./marts/core/schema.yml. The file describes each column in all relationships. Each column can have multiple tests configured under tests key. For example, we expect that fct_orders.order_id column will contain unique, non-null values. To validate that the data in the produced tables satisfies the test conditions run: dbt test Our model consists of just a few tables. Imagine a scenario where where we have many more sources of data and a much more complex dimensional model. We could also have an intermediate zone between the raw data and the dimensional model that follows the Data Vault 2.0 principles. Would it not be useful, if we had the inputs, transformations and outputs documented somehow? dbt allows us to generate documentation from its configuration files: dbt docs generate This will produce html files in ./target directory. You can start your own server to browse the documentation. The following command will start a server and open up a browser tab with the docs' landing page: dbt docs serve This tutorial demonstrated how to use dbt with Teradata Vantage. The sample project takes raw data and produces a dimensional data mart.

The utility has been deprecated. For new implementations consider using Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT). We often have a need to move large volumes of data into Vantage. Teradata offers Fastload utility that can efficiently load large amounts of data into Teradata Vantage. This how-to demonstrates how to use Fastload. In this scenario, we will load over 300k records, over 40MB of data, in a couple of seconds. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance.

The US Internal Revenue Service publishes them in S3 bucket. Let’s grab a summary of filings for 2020: https://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2020.csv. You can use your browser, wget or curl to save the file locally. Let’s create a database in Vantage. Use your favorite SQL tool to run the following query: CREATE DATABASE irs AS PERMANENT = 120e6, -- 120MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB We will now run Fastload. Fastload is a command-line tool that is very efficient in uploading large amounts of data into Vantage. Fastload, in order to be fast, has several restrictions in place. It can only populate empty tables, no inserts to already populated tables are supported. It doesn’t support tables with secondary indices. Also, it won’t insert duplicate records, even if a table is a MULTISET table. For the full list of restrictions check out Teradata® Fastload Reference. Fastload has its own scripting language. The language allows you to prepare the database with arbitrary SQL commands, declare the input source and define how the data should be inserted into Vantage. The tool supports both interactive and batch mode. In this section, we are going to use the interactive mode. Let’s start Fastload in the interactive mode: fastload First, let’s log in to a Vantage database. I’ve a Vantage Express running locally, so I’ll use localhost as the hostname and dbc for username and password: LOGON localhost/dbc,dbc; Now, that we are logged in, I’m going to prepare the database. I’m switching to irs database and making sure that the target table irs_returns and error tables (more about error tables later) do not exist: DATABASE irs; DROP TABLE irs_returns; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err1; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err2; I’ll now create an empty table that can hold the data elements from the csv file. CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns ( return_id INT, filing_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, ein INT, tax_period INT, sub_date VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, taxpayer_name VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, return_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, dln BIGINT, object_id BIGINT ) PRIMARY INDEX ( return_id ); Now, that the target table has been prepared, we can start loading the data. ERRORFILES directive defines error files. The error files are really tables that Fastload creates. The first table contains information about data conversion and other issues. The second table keeps track of data uniqueness issues, e.g. primary key violations. BEGIN LOADING irs_returns ERRORFILES irs_returns_err1, irs_returns_err2; We instruct Fastload to save a checkpoint every 10k rows. It’s useful in case we have to restart our job. It will be able to resume from the last checkpoint. CHECKPOINT 10000; We also need to tell Fastload to skip the first row in the CSV file as start at record 2. That’s because the first row contains column headers. RECORD 2; Fastload also needs to know that it’s a comma-separated file: SET RECORD VARTEXT \",\"; DEFINE block specifies what columns we should expect: DEFINE in_return_id (VARCHAR(19)), in_filing_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_ein (VARCHAR(19)), in_tax_period (VARCHAR(19)), in_sub_date (VARCHAR(22)), in_taxpayer_name (VARCHAR(100)), in_return_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_dln (VARCHAR(19)), in_object_id (VARCHAR(19)), DEFINE block also has FILE attribute that points to the file with the data. Replace FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; with your location of index_2020.csv file: FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; Finally, we define the INSERT statement that will put data into the database and we close off LOADING block: INSERT INTO irs_returns ( return_id, filing_type, ein, tax_period, sub_date, taxpayer_name, return_type, dln, object_id ) VALUES ( :in_return_id, :in_filing_type, :in_ein, :in_tax_period, :in_sub_date, :in_taxpayer_name, :in_return_type, :in_dln, :in_object_id ); END LOADING; Once the job has finished, we are logging off from the database to clean things up. LOGOFF; Here is what the entire script looks like: LOGON localhost/dbc,dbc; DATABASE irs; DROP TABLE irs_returns; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err1; DROP TABLE irs_returns_err2; CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns ( return_id INT, filing_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, ein INT, tax_period INT, sub_date VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, taxpayer_name VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, return_type VARCHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC, dln BIGINT, object_id BIGINT ) PRIMARY INDEX ( return_id ); BEGIN LOADING irs_returns ERRORFILES irs_returns_err1, irs_returns_err2; CHECKPOINT 10000; RECORD 2; SET RECORD VARTEXT \",\"; DEFINE in_return_id (VARCHAR(19)), in_filing_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_ein (VARCHAR(19)), in_tax_period (VARCHAR(19)), in_sub_date (VARCHAR(22)), in_taxpayer_name (VARCHAR(100)), in_return_type (VARCHAR(5)), in_dln (VARCHAR(19)), in_object_id (VARCHAR(19)), FILE = /tmp/index_2020.csv; INSERT INTO irs_returns ( return_id, filing_type, ein, tax_period, sub_date, taxpayer_name, return_type, dln, object_id ) VALUES ( :in_return_id, :in_filing_type, :in_ein, :in_tax_period, :in_sub_date, :in_taxpayer_name, :in_return_type, :in_dln, :in_object_id ); END LOADING; LOGOFF; To run our example in batch mode, simply save all instructions in a single file and run: fastload < file_with_instruction.fastload In our case, the file is in an S3 bucket. That means, that we can use Native Object Storage (NOS) to ingest the data: -- create an S3-backed foreign table CREATE FOREIGN TABLE irs_returns_nos USING ( LOCATION('/s3/s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2020.csv') ); -- load the data into a native table CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns_nos_native (RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME) AS ( SELECT RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME FROM irs_returns_nos ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; The NOS solution is convenient as it doesn’t depend on additional tools. It can be implemented using only SQL. It performs well, especially for Vantage deployments with a high number of AMPs as NOS tasks are delegated to AMPs and run in parallel. Also, splitting the data in object storage into multiple files may further improve performance. This how-to demonstrated how to ingest large amounts of data into Vantage.

Today we be gathering reference geographical data (official maps, points of interest, etc…​) form public sources and use it to support our day to day analytics. You will learn two methods to get your GeoJson data into Teradata Vantage: Load it as a single document and use native ClearScape analytics functions to parse it into a table usable for analytics. Lightly transform it in native Python as we load it into Vantage to produce an analytics ready dataset. The first method is a straig forward ELT pattern for semi-structured format processing in Vantage with a single SQL statement, the second one involves some lightweight preparation in (pure) Python and may allow more flexibility (for example to add early quality checks or optimize the load of large documents). You will need: Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. A Python 3 interpreter A SQL Client Here we will load a GeoJson document as a single Character Large OBject (CLOB) into the Vantage Data Store and use a single SQL statement, backed by ClearScape Analytics native functions, to parse this document into a usable structure for geospatial analytics. The http://geojson.xyz/ website is a fantastic source for open geographical data in GeoJson format. We will load the \"Populated Places\" dataset that provides with a list of over 1000 significant world cities. Open you favourite Python 3 interpreter and make sure you have the following packages installed: wget teradatasql getpass Download and read the cities dataset: import wget world_cities=wget.download('https://d2ad6b4ur7yvpq.cloudfront.net/naturalearth-3.3.0/ne_50m_populated_places.geojson') with open(world_cities) as geo_json: jmap = jmap = geo_json.read() Modify this code as needed with your Vantage host name, user name and specify an advanced login mechanism if any (eg. LDAP, Kerberos…​) with the logmech parameter if you need to. All the connection parameters are documented on the teradatasql PyPi page there: https://pypi.org/project/teradatasql/ The code below simply creates a Vantage connection, and opens a cursor creating a table and loading it with our file. import teradatasql import getpass tdhost='' tdUser='' # Create a connection to Teradata Vantage con = teradatasql.connect(None, host=tdhost, user=tdUser, password=getpass.getpass()) # Create a table named geojson_src and load the JSON map into it as a single CLOB with con.cursor () as cur: cur.execute (\"create table geojson_src (geojson_nm VARCHAR(32), geojson_clob CLOB CHARACTER SET UNICODE);\") r=cur.execute (\"insert into geojson_src (?, ?)\", ['cities',jmap]) Now open your favourite SQL client and connect to your Vantage system. We will use ClearScape analytics JSON functions to parse our GeoJson document and extract the most relevant properties and the geometry itself (the coordinates of the city) for each feature (each feature representing a city in this example). We then use the GeomFromGeoJSON function to cast our geometry as a native Vantage geometry data type (ST_GEOMETRY). For user convenience, will wrap all this SQL code in a view: REPLACE VIEW cities_geo AS SEL city_name, country_name, region_name, code_country_isoa3, GeomFromGeoJSON(geom, 4326) city_coord FROM JSON_Table (ON ( SEL geojson_nm id ,cast(geojson_clob as JSON) jsonCol FROM geojson_src where geojson_nm='cities' ) USING rowexpr('$.features[*]') colexpr('[ {\"jsonpath\" : \"$.geometry\", \"type\" : \"VARCHAR(32000)\"}, {\"jsonpath\" : \"$.properties.NAME\", \"type\" : \"VARCHAR(50)\"}, {\"jsonpath\" : \"$.properties.SOV0NAME\", \"type\" : \"VARCHAR(50)\"}, {\"jsonpath\" : \"$.properties.ADM1NAME\", \"type\" : \"VARCHAR(50)\"}, {\"jsonpath\" : \"$.properties.SOV_A3\", \"type\" : \"VARCHAR(50)\"}]') ) AS JT(id, geom, city_name, country_name, region_name, code_country_isoa3); That’s all, you can now view the prepared geometry data as a table, ready to enrich your analytics: SEL TOP 5 * FROM cities_geo; Result: city_name country_name region_name code_country_isoa3 city_coord Potenza Italy Basilicata ITA POINT (15.798996495640267 40.642002130098206) Mariehamn Finland Finström ALD POINT (19.949004471869102 60.096996184895431) Ramallah Indeterminate PSE POINT (35.206209378189556 31.902944751424059) Poitier French Republic Poitou-Charentes FRA POINT (0.333276528534554 46.583292255736581) Clermont-Ferrand French Republic Auvergne FRA POINT (3.080008095928406 45.779982115759424) Calculate the distance between two cities: SEL b.city_coord.ST_SphericalDistance(l.city_coord) FROM (SEL city_coord FROM cities_geo WHERE city_name='Bordeaux') b CROSS JOIN (SEL city_coord FROM cities_geo WHERE city_name='Lvov') l Result: city_coord.ST_SPHERICALDISTANCE(city_coord) 1.9265006861079421e+06 The previous example demonstrated how to load a complete document as a large object into Teradata Vantage and use built in analytic functions to parse it into a usable dataset. This is convenient but limited: we need to parse this document every time we need to use it, as the original document is not directly usable for analytics, JSON documents are currently limited to 16MB in Vantage and it may be inconvenient to fix data quality or formatting issues within the document stored as a CLOB. In this example, we will parse our JSON document using the Python json package and load it as a table that can be used directly and efficiently for analysis. Python json and list manipulation functions, along with the Teradata SQL driver for Python make this process really simple and efficient. For this example, we will use the boundaries of the world countries available on https://datahub.io. Let’s get into it. Open you favourite Python 3 interpreter and make sure you have the following packages installed: wget teradatasql getpass import wget countries_geojson=wget.download('https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries/r/countries.geojson') import json with open(countries_geojson) as geo_json: countries_json = json.load(geo_json) The good thing about loading this JSON in memory, if you are using an interactive Python terminal, is that you can now explore the document to understand its structure. For example print(countries_json.keys()) print(countries_json['type']) print(countries_json['features'][0]['properties'].keys()) print(countries_json['features'][0]['geometry']['coordinates']) What we have here is a collection of GeoFeatures (as earlier). We will now lightly model this data in a Vantage table, for that: We will load each feature as a raw. We will extract the properties that look interesting for immediate analysis (in our example, the country name and ISO code). We will extract the geometry itself and load it as a separate column. To load a set of rows with a teradatasql cursor, we need to represent each row as an array (or tuples) of values, and the complete dataset as an array of all the row-arrays. This is fairly easy to do as a list comprehension For example: [(f['properties']['ADMIN'], f['properties']['ISO_A3'], f['geometry']) for f in countries_json['features'][:1]] NB: Not featured here, but recommended for richer datasets, consider loading the entire and original feature payload as a separate column (this is a JSON document). This will allow you to go back to the original record and extract new properties that you may have missed during your first analysis but have become relevant, directly in SQL and without having to reload the file entirely. Modify this code as needed with your Vantage host name, user name and specify an advanced login mechanism if any (eg. LDAP, Kerberos…​) with the logmech parameter if you need to. All the connection parameters are documented on the teradatasql PyPi page there: https://pypi.org/project/teradatasql/ The code below simply creates a Vantage connection, and opens a cursor creating a table and loading it with our list. import teradatasql import getpass tdhost='' tdUser='' # Create a connection to Teradata Vantage con = teradatasql.connect(None, host=tdhost, user=tdUser, password=tdPassword) # Create a table and load our country names, codes, and geometries. with con.cursor () as cur: cur.execute (\"create table stg_countries_map (country_nm VARCHAR(32), ISO_A3_cd VARCHAR(32), boundaries_geo CLOB CHARACTER SET UNICODE);\") r=cur.execute (\"insert into stg_countries_map (?, ?, ?)\", [(f['properties']['ADMIN'], f['properties']['ISO_A3'], str(f['geometry'])) for f in countries_json['features']]) The code below performs the table creation from the Python interpreter, you can also run the sql statement defined below in your prefered SQL client you might as well simply define this logic as a SQL view to avoid having to refresh this table. We will use ClearScape analytics the GeomFromGeoJSON function to cast our geometry as a native Vantage geometry data type (ST_GEOMETRY). # Now create our final reference table, casting the geometry CLOB as a ST_GEOMETRY object sql=''' CREATE TABLE ref_countries_map AS ( SEL ISO_A3_cd ,country_nm ,GeomFromGeoJSON(boundaries_geo, 4326) boundaries_geo FROM stg_countries_map ) WITH DATA ''' WITH con.cursor () AS cur: cur.execute (sql) That’s all, you may now query your tables using your favourite SQL client and Teradata’s excellent Geospatial data types and analytic functions. For example, using the two datasets we have loaded during this tutorial, check in what countries are SEL cty.city_name, cty.city_coord, ctry.country_nm FROM cities_geo cty LEFT JOIN ref_countries_map ctry ON ctry.boundaries_geo.ST_Contains(cty.city_coord)=1 WHERE cty.city_name LIKE 'a%' city_name city_coord country_nm Acapulco POINT (-99.915979046410712 16.849990864016206) Mexico Aosta POINT (7.315002595706176 45.737001067072299) Italy Ancona POINT (13.499940550397127 43.600373554552903) Italy Albany POINT (117.891604776075155 -35.016946595501224) Australia Note that none of the above code does not implement any control procedure or checks to, for example, manage the state of the target tables, manage locking, control error codes, etc…​ This is meant to be a demonstrations of the available features to acquire and use geospatial reference data. Consider using SQLAlchemy ORM if you are defining your pipeline in Python, dbt, or your favorite ELT and orchestration toolset to create your products you can operationalize. You now can know how to get any open geographic dataset and use it to augment your analytics with Teradata Vantage!

The latest version of Vantage Express. If you have not used the Teradata downloads website before, you will need to register. The latest version of UTM. Install UTM by running the installer and accepting the default values. Go to the directory where you downloaded Vantage Express and unzip the downloaded file. Start UTM, click on the + sign and select Virtualize (for Intel Macs) or Emulate (for M1 Macs). On Operating System screen select Other. On Other screen select Skip ISO Boot. On Hardware screen allocate at least 4GB of memory and at least 1 CPU core. We recommend 10GB RAM and 2 CPUs. On Storage screen accept the defaults by clicking Next. On Shared Direct screen click Next. On Summary screen check Open VM Settings and click Save. Go through the setup wizard. You only need to adjust the following tabs: QEMU - disable UEFI Boot option Network - expose ssh (22) and Vantage (1025) ports on the host computer: Map drives: Delete the default IDE Drive. Map the 3 Vantage Express drives by importing the disk files from the downloaded VM zip file. Make sure you map them in the right order, -disk1, -disk2, -disk3 . The first disk is bootable and contains the database itself. Disks 2 and 3 are so called pdisks and contain data. As you import the files UTM will automatically convert them fro vmdk into qcow2 format. Make sure that each disk is configured using the IDE interface: Once you are done mapping all 3 drives, your configuration should look like this: Save the configuration and start the VM. Press ENTER to select the highlighted LINUX boot partition. On the next screen, press ENTER again to select the default SUSE Linux kernel.

If you are running Vantage Express on your laptop, you need to expose the port from the VM to the host machine. Refer to your virtualization software documentation how to forward ports. The project is set up. All that is left, is to load the driver, pass connection and authentication parameters and run a query: Run the tests: mvn test This how-to demonstrated how to connect to Teradata Vantage using JDBC. It described a sample Java application with Maven as the build tool that uses the Teradata JDBC driver to send SQL queries to Teradata Vantage.

A hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks integrated with Teradata Extensions and analytics tools is available for functional testing for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. In this how-to we will go through the steps for connecting to Teradata Vantage from a Jupyter notebook. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. There are a couple of ways to connect to Vantage from a Jupyter Notebook: Use python or R libraries in a regular Python/R kernel notebook - this option works well when you are in a restricted environment that doesn’t allow you to spawn your own Docker images. Also, it’s useful in traditional datascience scenarios when you have to mix SQL and Python/R in a notebook. If you are proficient with Jupyter and have your own set of preferred libraries and extensions, start with this option. Use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image - the Teradata Jupyter Docker image bundles the Teradata SQL kernel (more on this later), teradataml and tdplyr libraries, python and R drivers. It also contains Jupyter extensions that allow you to manage Teradata connections, explore objects in Vantage database. It’s convenient when you work a lot with SQL or would find a visual Navigator helpful. If you are new to Jupyter or if you prefer to get a currated assembly of libraries and extensions, start with this option. This option uses a regular Jupyter Lab notebook. We will see how to load the Teradata Python driver and use it from Python code. We will also examine ipython-sql extension that adds support for SQL-only cells. We start with a plain Jupyter Lab notebook. Here, I’m using docker but any method of starting a notebook, including Jupyter Hub, Google Cloud AI Platform Notebooks, AWS SageMaker Notebooks, Azure ML Notebooks will do. docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes \\ -v \"${PWD}\":/home/jovyan/work jupyter/datascience-notebook Docker logs will display the url that you need to go to: Entered start.sh with args: jupyter lab Executing the command: jupyter lab .... To access the server, open this file in a browser: file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html Or copy and paste one of these URLs: http://d5c2323ae5db:8888/lab?token=5fb43e674367c6895e8c2404188aa550b5c7bdf96f5b4a3a or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=5fb43e674367c6895e8c2404188aa550b5c7bdf96f5b4a3a We will open a new notebook and create a cell to install the required libraries: I’ve published a notebook with all the cells described below on GitHub: https://github.com/Teradata/quickstarts/blob/main/modules/ROOT/attachments/vantage-with-python-libraries.ipynb import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install teradatasqlalchemy Now, we will import Pandas and define the connection string to connect to Teradata. Since I’m running my notebook in Docker on my local machine and I want to connect to a local Vantage Express VM, I’m using host.docker.internal DNS name provided by Docker to reference the IP of my machine. import pandas as pd # Define the db connection string. Pandas uses SQLAlchemy connection strings. # For Teradata Vantage, it's teradatasql://username:password@host/database_name . # See https://pypi.org/project/teradatasqlalchemy/ for details. db_connection_string = \"teradatasql://dbc:dbc@host.docker.internal/dbc\" I can now call Pandas to query Vantage and move the result to a Pandas dataframe: pd.read_sql(\"SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo\", con = db_connection_string) The syntax above is concise but it can get tedious if all you need is to explore data in Vantage. We will use ipython-sql and its %%sql magic to create SQL-only cells. We start with importing the required libraries. import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install ipython-sql teradatasqlalchemy We load ipython-sql and define the db connection string: %load_ext sql # Define the db connection string. The sql magic uses SQLAlchemy connection strings. # For Teradata Vantage, it's teradatasql://username:password@host/database_name . # See https://pypi.org/project/teradatasqlalchemy/ for details. %sql teradatasql://dbc:dbc@host.docker.internal/dbc We can now use %sql and %%sql magic. Let’s say we want to explore data in a table. We can create a cell that says: %%sql SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo If we want to move the data to a Pandas frame, we can say: result = %sql SELECT * FROM dbc.dbcinfo result.DataFrame() There are many other features that ipython-sql provides, including variable substitution, plotting with matplotlib, writting results to a local csv file or back to the database. See the demo notebook for examples and ipython-sql github repo for a complete reference. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image builds on jupyter/datascience-notebook Docker image. It adds the Teradata SQL kernel, Teradata Python and R libraries, Jupyter extensions to make you productive while interacting with Teradata Vantage. The image also contains sample notebooks that demonstrate how to use the SQL kernel and Teradata libraries. The SQL kernel and Teradata Jupyter extensions are useful for people that spend a lot of time with the SQL interface. Think about it as a notebook experience that, in many cases, is more convenient than using Teradata Studio. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image doesn’t try to replace Teradata Studio. It doesn’t have all the features. It’s designed for people who need a lightweight, web-based interface and enjoy the notebook UI. The Teradata Jupyter Docker image can be used when you want to run Jupyter locally or you have a place where you can run custom Jupyter docker images. The steps below demonstrate how to use the image locally. Run the image: By passing -e \"accept_license=Y you accept the license agreement for Teradata Jupyter Extensions. docker volume create notebooks docker run -e \"accept_license=Y\" -p :8888:8888 \\ -v notebooks:/home/jovyan/JupyterLabRoot \\ teradata/jupyterlab-extensions Docker logs will display the url that you need to go to. For example, this is what I’ve got: Starting JupyterLab ... Docker Build ID = 3.2.0-ec02012022 Using unencrypted HTTP Enter this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8888?token=96a3ab874a03779c400966bf492fe270c2221cdcc74b61ed * Or enter this token when prompted by Jupyter: 96a3ab874a03779c400966bf492fe270c2221cdcc74b61ed * If you used a different port to run your Docker, replace 8888 with your port number Open up the URL and use the file explorer to open the following notebook: jupyterextensions → notebooks → sql → GettingStartedDemo.ipynb. Go through the demo of the Teradata SQL Kernel: This quick start covered different options to connect to Teradata Vantage from a Jupyter Notebook. We learned about the Teradata Jupyter Docker image that bundles multiple Teradata Python and R libraries. It also provides an SQL kernel, database object explorer and connection management. These features are useful when you spend a lot of time with the SQL interface. For more traditional data science scenarios, we explored the standalone Teradata Python driver and integration through the ipython sql extension.

Customize an existing Docker image to include Teradata extensions. This page contains detailed instructions on the two options. Instructions are based on the assumption that the customer JupyterHub deployment is based on Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Teradata provides a ready-to-run Docker image that builds on the jupyter/datascience-notebook image. It bundles the Teradata SQL kernel, Teradata Python and R libraries and drivers and Teradata extensions for Jupyter to make you productive while interacting with Teradata database. The image also contains sample notebooks that demonstrate how to use the SQL kernel, extensions and Teradata libraries. You can use this image in the following ways: Start a personal Jupyter Notebook server in a local Docker container Run JupyterLab servers for a team using JupyterHub For instructions to start a personal JupyterLab server in a local Docker container, please see installation guide. This section will focus on how to use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image in a customer’s existing JupyterHub environment. Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page and download the Docker image. It is a tarball with name in this format teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz. Load the image: docker load -i teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION.tar.gz Push the image to your Docker registry: docker push You may want to consider changing the name of the loaded image for simplicity: docker tag OLD_IMAGE_NAME NEW_IMAGE_NAME To use the Teradata Jupyter Docker image directly in your JupyterHub cluster, modify the override file as described in herein the JupyterHub documentation. Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values from the step above: singleuser: image: name: REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION tag: latest Apply the changes to the cluster as described in JupyterHub documentation. You can use multiple profiles to allow users to select which image they want to use when they log in to JupyterHub. For detailed instructions and examples on configuring multiple profiles, please see JupyterHub documentation. If your users need some packages or notebooks that are not bundled in the Teradata Jupyter Docker image, we recommend that you use Teradata image as a base image and build a new one on top of it. Here is an example Dockerfile that builds on top of Teradata image and adds additional packages and notebooks. Use the Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster as described above. Replace REGISTRY_URL and VERSION with appropriate values: FROM REGISTRY_URL/teradatajupyterlabext_VERSION:latest # install additional packages RUN pip install --no-cache-dir astropy # copy notebooks COPY notebooks/. /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/DemoNotebooks/ If you prefer, you can include the Teradata SQL kernel and extensions into into an existing image you are currently using. Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page to download the zipped Teradata Jupyter extensions package bundle. Assuming your existing docker image is Linux based, you will want to use the Linux version of the download. Otherwise, download for the platform you are using. The .zip file contains the Teradata SQL Kernel, extensions and sample notebooks. Unzip the bundle file to your working directory. Below is an example Dockerfile to add Teradata Jupyter extensions to your existing Docker image. Use the Dockerfile to build a new Docker image, push the image to a designated registry, modify override file as shown above to use the new image as singleuser image, apply the changes to the cluster: FROM REGISTRY_URL/your-existing-image:tag ENV NB_USER=jovyan \\ HOME=/home/jovyan \\ EXT_DIR=/opt/teradata/jupyterext/packages USER root ############################################################## # Install kernel and copy supporting files ############################################################## # Copy the kernel COPY ./teradatakernel /usr/local/bin RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/teradatakernel # Copy directory with kernel.json file into image COPY ./teradatasql teradatasql/ ############################################################## # Switch to user jovyan to copy the notebooks and license files. ############################################################## USER $NB_USER # Copy notebooks COPY ./notebooks/ /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/TeradataSampleNotebooks/ # Copy license files COPY ./ThirdPartyLicenses /tmp/JupyterLabRoot/ThirdPartyLicenses/ USER root # Install the kernel file to /opt/conda jupyter lab instance RUN jupyter kernelspec install ./teradatasql --prefix=/opt/conda ############################################################## # Install Teradata extensions ############################################################## COPY ./teradata_*.tgz $EXT_DIR WORKDIR $EXT_DIR RUN jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_database* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_resultset* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_sqlhighlighter* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_connection_manager* && \\ jupyter labextension install --no-build teradata_preferences* && \\ jupyter lab build --dev-build=False --minimize=False && \\ rm -rf * WORKDIR $HOME # Give back ownership of /opt/conda to jovyan RUN chown -R jovyan:users /opt/conda # Jupyter will create .local directory RUN rm -rf $HOME/.local You can optionally install Teradata package for Python and Teradata package for R.

You have a model type in mind. You don’t want to operationalize with an ML pipeline just yet. You just want to test out if the relationship you had in mind exists. Also, sometimes even your production deployment doesn’t require constant relearning with MLops. In such cases, you can use Vantage Analytics Library (VAL) and multiple ML model types it supports. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a new instance of Vantage, you can install a free version called Vantage Express in the cloud on Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS. You can also run Vantage Express on your local machine using VMware, VirtualBox, or UTM. Support for ML in Vantage requires Vantage Analytics Library (VAL). In this section, we will install VAL and load some sample data. VAL is distributed as an rpm file. Go to Teradata Downloads and download the VAL rpm to your local machine. Upload the file to your Vantage install. If you are running Vantage Express locally, you have many ways to do it: If you installed Vantage Express on VirtualBox, you should be able to drag & drop the file to the VM’s desktop. You can also use scp by connecting to port 4422, e.g.: scp -P 4422 ~/Downloads/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm root@localhost:/root/Desktop If you use VMware and you have enabled drag & drop, you should be able to drag and drop the file to the VM’s desktop. If you have SSH access to your Vantage nodes, you can use scp to upload the binary, e.g.: scp ~/Downloads/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm root@vantage.server.name:/tmp/ We will now create a new database where VAL functions and procedures will be installed. You could install VAL in a global location such as SYSLIB, but installing VAL in a specific database will make it easier to start over if things go wrong. Let’s create a database called val and grant appropriate permissions to our user. Please edit to match your database name and user id: CREATE DATABASE val AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB GRANT CREATE FUNCTION ON val to dbc; GRANT ALTER FUNCTION ON val to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.REMOVE_JAR to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR to dbc; GRANT EXECUTE PROCEDURE on SQLJ.REPLACE_JAR to dbc; GRANT CREATE EXTERNAL PROCEDURE ON val to dbc; Open Gnome Terminal in the VM and start the installation process. Adjust the rpm path as necessary: rpm -Uvh --nodeps ~/Desktop/VAL-2.0.0.3-1.x86_64.rpm The install wizard will ask you for the hostname, user id, and password. If you are running the install on your Vantage Express VM, the values are: Hostname: localhost Userid: dbc Password: dbc Account string: leave empty, press ENTER BTEQ or FASTLOAD command: leave empty, press ENTER The wizard will ask you to choose which part of VAL you want to install. We want to start with installing td_analyze procedure, i.e. option 1. Once you select option 1, the script will ask for the database name where td_analyze will be installed. Enter val and press ENTER. While still in the wizard, install option 5, i.e. Tutorial Tables. These are sample tables with data that we are going to use to build a sample model. Now, that we have VAL and sample tables loaded, let’s explore the data. It’s a simplistic, fictitious dataset of banking customers (1K-ish rows), Accounts (10K-ish rows) and Transactions (100K-ish rows). They are related to each other in the following ways: In later parts of this how-to we are going to explore if we can build a model that predicts average monthly balance that a banking customer has on their credit card based on all non-credit card related variables in the tables. Let’s start by creating a wide table (Analytic Data Set, or ADS) that joins the three tables above. You must have CREATE TABLE permissions on the Database where the Vantage Analytic Library is installed. -- Switch to val database. DATABASE val; -- Create the ADS. CREATE TABLE VAL_ADS AS ( SELECT T1.cust_id AS cust_id ,MIN(T1.income) AS tot_income ,MIN(T1.age) AS tot_age ,MIN(T1.years_with_bank) AS tot_cust_years ,MIN(T1.nbr_children) AS tot_children ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS single_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.gender) = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS female_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS married_ind ,CASE WHEN MIN(T1.marital_status) = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS separated_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'CA' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ca_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'NY' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ny_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'TX' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS tx_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'IL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS il_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'AZ' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS az_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T1.state_code = 'OH' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS oh_resident_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ck_acct_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sv_acct_ind ,MAX(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cc_acct_ind ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS ck_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS sv_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN T2.starting_balance+T2.ending_balance ELSE 0 END) AS cc_avg_bal ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CK' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS ck_avg_tran_amt ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'SV' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS sv_avg_tran_amt ,AVG(CASE WHEN T2.acct_type = 'CC' THEN T3.principal_amt+T3.interest_amt ELSE 0 END) AS cc_avg_tran_amt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 1 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q1_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 2 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q2_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 3 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q3_trans_cnt ,COUNT(CASE WHEN ((EXTRACT(MONTH FROM T3.tran_date) + 2) / 3) = 4 THEN T3.tran_id ELSE NULL END) AS q4_trans_cnt FROM Customer AS T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN Accounts AS T2 ON T1.cust_id = T2.cust_id LEFT OUTER JOIN Transactions AS T3 ON T2.acct_nbr = T3.acct_nbr GROUP BY T1.cust_id) WITH DATA UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX (cust_id); We will now build a linear regression model that takes parameters from the dataset and tries to predict the monthly credit card balance. We call td_analyze and tell it we want a linear model. The input is in table VAL_ADS and consists of multiple columns. The dependent variable is cc_avg_bal. We want the model to be written to val database in table called LINEAR_REGRESSION_DEMO: call td_analyze('linear', 'database=val; tablename=VAL_ADS; columns=tot_age,tot_income,tot_cust_years,tot_children,single_ind,female_ind,married_ind,separated_ind,ck_acct_ind,sv_acct_ind,sv_avg_bal,ck_avg_bal,ca_resident_ind,ny_resident_ind,tx_resident_ind,il_resident_ind,az_resident_ind,oh_resident_ind; dependent=cc_avg_bal; outputdatabase=val; outputtablename=linear_regression_demo'); The procedure creates several output tables. For now, we don’t have to analyze what is in the tables. Let’s see how we can use the newly created model to perform scoring. Let’s use the model to perform predictions and evaluate the scores. To do this, we call td_analyze with linearscore parameter. We point to the input table (VAL_ADS), the model tables (prefix linear_regression_demo) and define the target table (linear_regression_score) in val database: call td_analyze('linearscore', 'database=val; tablename=VAL_ADS; modeldatabase=val; modeltablename=linear_regression_demo; outputdatabase=val; outputtablename=linear_regression_score; predicted=estimate; retain=cc_avg_bal; scoringmethod=scoreandevaluate;'); As a result, we get linear_regression_score table that contains the real balance, the predicted balance and the difference between these two. Let’s have a look at a sample: SELECT * FROM linear_regression_score SAMPLE 10; You will see results similar to: cust_id|cc_avg_bal |estimate |Residual | -------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+ 1362498| 0.0| 284.7057772484358| -284.7057772484358| 1362828| 1184.35|463.74177458594215| 720.6082254140578| 1362839| 2933.135802469136| 982.9240031182255| 1950.2117993509103| 1362986| 500.9148148148148| 881.4116539412856| -380.4968391264708| 1362511|235.85941489361701|294.35369563202846|-58.494280738411426| 1363134| 0.0|430.27950420065997|-430.27950420065997| 1363481| 0.0| 411.2359958542745| -411.2359958542745| 1362644| 209.3304347826087|279.75770904482033| -70.42727426221163| 1363141| 0.0| 550.1681921045503| -550.1681921045503| 1363290| 0.0|120.35348558871233|-120.35348558871233| In this quick start we have learned how to create ML models in SQL.

The database connector is configured to extract this value and use it in this SQL query: SELECT * FROM hr.employees WHERE LastName = :lastName As you can see, we are using parameterized query with reference to the value of the parameter passed to the HTTP connector. So if the HTTP connector receives http://localhost:8081/?lastname=Smith, the SQL query will be: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name = Smith The database connector instructs the database server to run the SQL query, retrieves the result of the query, and passes it to the Transform message processor which converts the result to JSON.

It’s useful in scenarios where you want to explore data without building a data pipeline to bring it into Vantage. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. NOS is enabled in all Vantage editions from Vantage Express through Developer, DYI to Vantage as a Service starting from version 17.10. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Currently, NOS supports CSV, JSON (as array or new-line delimited), and Parquet data formats. Let’s say you have a dataset stored as CSV files in an S3 bucket. You want to explore the dataset before you decide if you want to bring it into Vantage. For this scenario, we are going to use a public dataset published by Teradata that contains river flow data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. The bucket is at https://td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/. Let’s first have a look at sample CSV data. We take the first 10 rows that Vantage will fetch from the bucket: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' ) AS d; Here is what I’ve got: GageHeight2 Flow site_no datetime Precipitation GageHeight ----------- ----- -------- ---------------- ------------- ----------- 10.9 15300 09380000 2018-06-28 00:30 671 9.80 10.8 14500 09380000 2018-06-28 01:00 673 9.64 10.7 14100 09380000 2018-06-28 01:15 672 9.56 11.0 16200 09380000 2018-06-27 00:00 669 9.97 10.9 15700 09380000 2018-06-27 00:30 668 9.88 10.8 15400 09380000 2018-06-27 00:45 672 9.82 10.8 15100 09380000 2018-06-27 01:00 672 9.77 10.8 14700 09380000 2018-06-27 01:15 672 9.68 10.9 16000 09380000 2018-06-27 00:15 668 9.93 10.8 14900 09380000 2018-06-28 00:45 672 9.72 We have got plenty of numbers, but what do they mean? To answer this question, we will ask Vantage to detect the schema of the CSV files: SELECT * FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' RETURNTYPE='NOSREAD_SCHEMA' ) AS d; Vantage will now fetch a data sample to analyze the schema and return results: Name Datatype FileType Location --------------- ----------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- GageHeight2 decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv Flow decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv site_no int csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv datetime TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT'Y4-MM-DDBHH:MI' csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv Precipitation decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv GageHeight decimal(3,2) csv /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09513780/2018/06/27.csv We see that the CSV files have 6 columns. For each column, we get the name, the datatype and the file coordinates that were used to infer the schema. Now that we know the schema, we can work with the dataset as if it was a regular SQL table. To prove the point, let’s try to do some data aggregation. Let’s get an average temperature per site for sites that collect temperatures. SELECT site_no Site_no, AVG(Flow) Avg_Flow FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' ) AS d GROUP BY site_no HAVING Avg_Flow IS NOT NULL; Result: Site_no Avg_Flow -------- --------- 09380000 11 09423560 73 09424900 93 09429070 81 To register your ad hoc exploratory activity as a permanent source, create it as a foreign table: -- If you are running this sample as dbc user you will not have permissions -- to create a table in dbc database. Instead, create a new database and use -- the newly create database to create a foreign table. CREATE DATABASE Riverflow AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB -- change current database to Riverflow DATABASE Riverflow; CREATE FOREIGN TABLE riverflow USING ( LOCATION('/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/') ); SELECT top 10 * FROM riverflow; Result: Location GageHeight2 Flow site_no datetime Precipitation GageHeight ------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ---- ------- ------------------- ------------- ---------- /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09429070/2018/07/02.csv null null 9429070 2018-07-02 14:40:00 1.21 null /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:30:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:45:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 01:00:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09400815/2018/07/10.csv null 0.00 9400815 2018-07-10 00:15:00 0.00 -0.01 /S3/s3.amazonaws.com/td-usgs-public/CSVDATA/09429070/2018/07/02.csv null null 9429070 2018-07-02 14:38:00 1.06 null This time, the SELECT statement looks like a regular select against an in-database table. If you require subsecond response time when querying the data, there is an easy way to bring the CSV data into Vantage to speed things up. Read on to find out how. Querying object storage takes time. What if you decided that the data looks interesting and you want to do some more analysis with a solution that will you quicker answers? The good news is that data returned with NOS can be used as a source for CREATE TABLE statements. Assuming you have CREATE TABLE privilege, you will be able to run: This query assumes you created database Riverflow and a foreign table called riverflow in the previous step. -- This query assumes you created database `Riverflow` -- and a foreign table called `riverflow` in the previous step. CREATE MULTISET TABLE riverflow_native (site_no, Flow, GageHeight, datetime) AS ( SELECT site_no, Flow, GageHeight, datetime FROM riverflow ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; SELECT TOP 10 * FROM riverflow_native; Result: site_no Flow GageHeight datetime ------- ----- ---------- ------------------- 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:30:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:00:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:30:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 02:00:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 02:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 01:45:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:45:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:15:00 9400815 .00 -.01 2018-07-10 00:00:00 This time, the SELECT query returned in less than a second. Vantage didn’t have to fetch the data from NOS. Instead, it answered using data that was already on its nodes. So far, we have used a public bucket. What if you have a private bucket? How do you tell Vantage what credentials it should use? It is possible to inline your credentials directly into your query: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM ( LOCATION='/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/' AUTHORIZATION='{\"ACCESS_ID\":\"\",\"ACCESS_KEY\":\"\"}' ) AS d; Entering these credentials all the time can be tedious and less secure. In Vantage, you can create an authorization object that will serve as a container for your credentials: CREATE AUTHORIZATION aws_authorization USER 'YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID' PASSWORD 'YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'; You can then reference your authorization object when you create a foreign table: CREATE FOREIGN TABLE riverflow , EXTERNAL SECURITY aws_authorization USING ( LOCATION('/s3/td-usgs-public.s3.amazonaws.com/CSVDATA/') ); So far, we have talked about reading and importing data from object storage. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a way to use SQL to export data from Vantage to object storage? This is exactly what WRITE_NOS function is for. Let’s say we want to export data from riverflow_native table to object storage. You can do so with the following query: SELECT * FROM WRITE_NOS ( ON ( SELECT * FROM riverflow_native ) PARTITION BY site_no ORDER BY site_no USING LOCATION('YOUR-OBJECT-STORE-URI') AUTHORIZATION(aws_authorization) STOREDAS('PARQUET') COMPRESSION('SNAPPY') NAMING('RANGE') INCLUDE_ORDERING('TRUE') ) AS d; Here, we instruct Vantage to take data from riverflow_native and save it in YOUR-OBJECT-STORE-URI bucket using parquet format. The data will be split into files by site_no attribute. The files will be compressed. In this quick start we have learned how to read data from object storage using Native Object Storage (NOS) functionality in Vantage. NOS supports reading and importing data stored in CSV, JSON and Parquet formats. NOS can also export data from Vantage to object storage.

But, now let’s go a step further to identify how many passengers are being picked up and what is the average trip duration by vendor every 15 minutes in November.

Without needing complicated, cumbersome logic we are able to find average trip duration by vendor every 15 minutes just by modifying the group by time clause. Let’s now look at how simple it is to build moving averages based on this. First, let’s start by creating a view as below. REPLACE VIEW NYC_taxi_trip_ts as SELECT $TD_TIMECODE_RANGE time_bucket_per ,vendor_id ,sum(passenger_count) passenger_cnt ,avg(CAST((dropoff_datetime - pickup_datetime MINUTE(4) ) AS INTEGER)) avg_trip_time_in_mins FROM trip GROUP BY TIME (MINUTES(15) and vendor_id) USING TIMECODE(pickup_datetime) WHERE extract(month from pickup_datetime)=11 Let’s calculate a 2 hours moving average on our 15-minutes time series. 2 hour is 8 * 15 minutes periods. SELECT * FROM MovingAverage ( ON NYC_taxi_trip_ts PARTITION BY vendor_id ORDER BY time_bucket_per USING MAvgType ('S') WindowSize (8) TargetColumns ('passenger_cnt') ) AS dt WHERE begin(time_bucket_per)(date) = '2014-11-25' ORDER BY vendor_id, time_bucket_per; Result: time_bucket_per vendor_id passenger_cnt avg_trip_time_in_mins passenger_cnt_smavg --------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------- -------------------- -------------------- (2013-11-04 14:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 15:00:00.000000) VTS 2 9 1.375 (2013-11-04 15:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 15:30:00.000000) VTS 1 11 1.375 (2013-11-04 15:30:00.000000, 2013-11-04 15:45:00.000000) VTS 1 31 1.375 (2013-11-04 16:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 16:30:00.000000) VTS 2 16 1.375 (2013-11-04 16:30:00.000000, 2013-11-04 16:45:00.000000) VTS 1 3 1.375 (2013-11-04 16:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 17:00:00.000000) VTS 6 38 2 (2013-11-04 17:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 17:30:00.000000) VTS 2 29.5 2.125 (2013-11-04 17:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 18:00:00.000000) VTS 9 20.33333333 3 (2013-11-04 18:00:00.000000, 2013-11-04 18:15:00.000000) VTS 6 23.4 3.5 (2013-11-04 18:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 18:30:00.000000) VTS 4 15.66666667 3.875 (2013-11-04 18:30:00.000000, 2013-11-04 18:45:00.000000) VTS 8 24.5 4.75 (2013-11-04 18:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 19:00:00.000000) VTS 23 38.33333333 7.375 (2013-11-04 19:00:00.000000, 2013-11-04 19:15:00.000000) VTS 195 26.61538462 31.625 (2013-11-04 19:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 19:30:00.000000) VTS 774 13.70083102 127.625 (2013-11-04 19:30:00.000000, 2013-11-04 19:45:00.000000) VTS 586 12.38095238 200.625 (2013-11-04 19:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 20:00:00.000000) VTS 1236 15.54742097 354 (2013-11-04 20:00:00.000000, 2013-11-04 20:15:00.000000) VTS 3339 11.78947368 770.625 (2013-11-04 20:15:00.000000, 2013-11-04 20:30:00.000000) VTS 3474 10.5603396 1204.375 (2013-11-04 20:30:00.000000, 2013-11-04 20:45:00.000000) VTS 3260 12.26484323 1610.875 (2013-11-04 20:45:00.000000, 2013-11-04 21:00:00.000000) VTS 5112 12.05590062 2247 In addition to above time series operations, Vantage also provides a special time series tables with Primary Time Index (PTI). These are regular Vantage tables with PTI defined rather than a Primary Index (PI). Though tables with PTI are not mandatory for time series functionality/operations, PTI optimizes how the time series data is stored physically and hence improves performance considerably compared to regular tables. In this quick start we have learnt how easy it is to analyse time series datasets using Vantage’s time series capabilities.

One option is to wrap your logic in a User Defined Function (UDF). What if you already have this logic coded in a language that is not supported by UDF? Script Table Operator is a Vantage feature that allows you to bring your logic to the data and run it on Vantage. The advantage of this approach is that you don’t have to retrieve data from Vantage to operate on it. Also, by running your data applications on Vantage, you leverage its parallel nature. You don’t have to think how your applications will scale. You can let Vantage take care of it. You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Let’s start with something simple. What if you wanted the database to print \"Hello World\"? SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( SCRIPT_COMMAND('echo Hello World!') RETURNS ('Message varchar(512)')); Here is what I’ve got: Message ------------ Hello World! Hello World! Let’s analyze what just happened here. The SQL includes echo Hello World!. This is a Bash command. OK, so now we know how to run Bash commands. But why did we get 2 rows and not one? That’s because our simple script was run once on each AMP and I happen to have 2 AMPs: -- Teradata magic that returns the number of AMPs in a system SELECT hashamp()+1 AS number_of_amps; Returns: number_of_amps -------------- 2 This simple script demonstrates the idea behind the Script Table Operator (STO). You provide your script and the database runs it in parallel, once for each AMP. This is an attractive model in case you have transformation logic in a script and a lot of data to process. Normally, you would need to build concurrency into your application. By letting STO do it, you let Teradata select the right concurrency level for your data. OK, so we did echo in Bash but Bash is hardly a productive environment to express complex logic. What other languages are supported then? The good news is that any binary that can run on Vantage nodes can be used in STO. Remember, that the binary and all its dependencies need to be installed on all your Vantage nodes. In practice, it means that your options will be limited to what your administrator is willing and able to maintain on your servers. Python is a very popular choice. Ok, Hello World is super exciting, but what if we have existing logic in a large file. Surely, you don’t want to paste your entire script and escape quotes in an SQL query. We solve the script upload issue with the User Installed Files (UIF) feature. Say you have helloworld.py script with the following content: print(\"Hello World!\") Let’s assume the script is on your local machine at /tmp/helloworld.py. First, we need to setup permissions in Vantage. We are going to do this using a new database to keep it clean. -- Create a new database called sto CREATE DATABASE STO AS PERMANENT = 60e6, -- 60MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB -- Allow dbc user to create scripts in database STO GRANT CREATE EXTERNAL PROCEDURE ON STO to dbc; You can upload the script to Vantage using the following procedure call: call SYSUIF.install_file('helloworld', 'helloworld.py', 'cz!/tmp/helloworld.py'); Now that the script has been uploaded, you can call it like this: -- We switch to STO database DATABASE STO -- We tell Vantage where to look for the script. This can be -- any string and it will create a symbolic link to the directory -- where our script got uploaded. By convention, we use the -- database name. SET SESSION SEARCHUIFDBPATH = sto; -- We now call the script. Note, how we use a relative path that -- starts with `./sto/`, which is where SEARCHUIFDBPATH -- is pointing. SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( SCRIPT_COMMAND('python3 ./sto/helloworld.py') RETURNS ('Message varchar(512)')); The last call should return: Message ------------ Hello World! Hello World! That was a lot of work and we are still at Hello World. Let’s try to pass some data into SCRIPT. So far, we have been using SCRIPT operator to run standalone scripts. But the main purpose to run scripts on Vantage is to process data that is in Vantage. Let’s see how we can retrieve data from Vantage and pass it to SCRIPT. We will start with creating a table with a few rows. -- Switch to STO database. DATABASE STO -- Create a table with a few urls CREATE TABLE urls(url varchar(10000)); INS urls('https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:TDC'); INS urls('http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xteradata+merchandise&_nkw=teradata+merchandise&_sacat=0&_from=R40'); INS urls('https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=teradata%20commercial&sm=3'); INS urls('https://www.contrivedexample.com/example?mylist=1&mylist=2&mylist=...testing'); We will use the following script to parse out query parameters: from urllib.parse import urlparse from urllib.parse import parse_qsl import sys for line in sys.stdin: # remove leading and trailing whitespace url = line.strip() parsed_url = urlparse(url) query_params = parse_qsl(parsed_url.query) for element in query_params: print(\"\\t\".join(element)) Note, how the scripts assumes that urls will be fed into stdin one by one, line by line. Also, note how it prints results line by line, using the tab character as a delimiter between values. Let’s install the script. Here, we assume that the script file is at /tmp/urlparser.py on our local machine: CALL SYSUIF.install_file('urlparser', 'urlparser.py', 'cz!/tmp/urlparser.py'); With the script installed, we will now retrieve data from urls table and feed it into the script to retrieve query parameters: -- We inform Vantage to create a symbolic link from the UIF directory to ./sto/ SET SESSION SEARCHUIFDBPATH = sto ; SELECT * FROM SCRIPT( ON(SELECT url FROM urls) SCRIPT_COMMAND('python3 ./sto/urlparser.py') RETURNS ('param_key varchar(512)', 'param_value varchar(512)')); As a result, we get query params and their values. There are as many rows as key/value pairs. Also, since we inserted a tab between the key and the value output in the script, we get 2 columns from STO. param_key |param_value ------------+----------------------------------------------------- q |NYSE:TDC _trksid |p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xteradata merchandise search_query|teradata commercial _nkw |teradata merchandise sm |3 _sacat |0 mylist |1 _from |R40 mylist |2 mylist |...testing We have learned how to take data from Vantage, pass it to a script and get output.

You should also change the default password to dbc user: To change the password for dbc user go to your VM and start bteq: bteq Login to your database using dbc as username and password: .logon localhost/dbc Change the password for dbc user: MODIFY USER dbc AS PASSWORD = new_password; You can now open up port 1025 to the internet using gcloud command: gcloud compute firewall-rules create vantage-express --allow=tcp:1025 --direction=IN --target-tags=ve To stop incurring charges, delete the VM: gcloud compute instances delete teradata-vantage-express --zone=us-central1-a Also, remember to remove any firewall rules that you have added, e.g.: gcloud compute firewall-rules delete vantage-express Query data stored in object storage Teradata® Studio™ and Studio™ Express Installation Guide Introduction to BTEQ Did this page help?","title":"Run Vantage Express on Google Cloud","component":"ROOT","version":"master","name":"vantage.express.gcp","url":"/en/vantage.express.gcp.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","id":"_overview"},{"text":"Prerequisites","id":"_prerequisites"},{"text":"Installation","id":"_installation"},{"text":"Run sample queries","id":"_run_sample_queries"},{"text":"Optional setup","id":"_optional_setup"},{"text":"Cleanup","id":"_cleanup"},{"text":"Next steps","id":"_next_steps"},{"text":"Further reading","id":"_further_reading"}]},"/en/business-intelligence/create-stunning-visualizations-in-power-bi-using-data-from-teradata-vantage.html":{"text":"Author: Kevin Bogusch, Paul Ibberson Last updated: January 14th, 2022 This guide includes content from both Microsoft and Teradata product documentation. This article describes the process to connect your Power BI Desktop to Teradata Vantage for creating reports and dramatic visualizations of your data. Power BI supports Teradata Vantage as a data source and can use the underlying data just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop. Power BI is a collection of software services, applications, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI consists of: A Windows desktop application, called Power BI Desktop An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service, called the Power BI service Power BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices These three elements—Power BI Desktop, the Power BI service, and the mobile apps—are designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively. A fourth element, Power BI Report Server, allows you to publish Power BI reports to an on-premises report server, after creating them in Power BI Desktop. Power BI Desktop supports Vantage as a 3rd party data source not as a ‘native’ data source. Instead, published reports on Power BI service will need to use the on-premises data gateway component to access Vantage. This getting started guide will show you how to connect to a Teradata Vantage. Power BI Desktop Teradata connector uses the .NET Data Provider for Teradata. You need to install the driver on computers that use the Power BI Desktop. The .NET Data Provider for Teradata single installation supports both 32-bit or 64-bit Power BI Desktop application. You are expected to be familiar with Azure services, Teradata Vantage, and Power BI Desktop. You will need the following accounts and system. The Power BI Desktop is a free application for Windows. (Power BI Desktop is not available for Macs. You could run it in a virtual machine, such as Parallels or VMware Fusion, or in Apple’s Boot Camp, but that is beyond the scope of this article.) A Teradata Vantage instance with a user and password. The user must have permission to data that can be used by Power BI Desktop. Vantage must be accessible from Power BI Desktop. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. The .NET Data Provider for Teradata. You can install Power BI Desktop from the Microsoft Store or download the installer and run it directly. Download and install the latest version of the .NET Data Provider for Teradata. Note that there are multiple files available for download. You want the file that starts with “tdnetdp”. Run Power BI Desktop, which has a yellow icon. If the opening (splash) screen is showing, click on Get data. Otherwise, if you are in the main form of Power BI, ensure that you are on the Home ribbon and click on Get data. Click on More…. Click on Database on the left. Scroll the list on the right until you see Teradata database. Click on Teradata database, and then click on the Connect button. (“Teradata database” and “Teradata Vantage” are synonymous in this article.) In the window that appears, enter the name or IP address of your Vantage system into the text box. You can choose to Import data directly into Power BI data model, or connect directly to the data source using DirectQuery and click OK. (Click Advanced options to submit hand-crafted SQL statement.) For credentials, you have the option of connecting with your Windows login or Database username defined in Vantage, which is more common. Select the appropriate authentication method and enter in your username and password. Click Connect. You also have the option of authenticating with an LDAP server. This option is hidden by default. If you set the environment variable, PBI_EnableTeradataLdap, to true, then the LDAP authentication method will become available. Do note that LDAP is not supported with the on-premises data gateway, which is used for reports that are published to the Power BI service. If you need LDAP authentication and are using the on-premises data gateway, you will need to submit an incident to Microsoft and request support. Alternatively, you can configure Kerberos-based SSO from Power BI service to on-premise data sources like Teradata. Once you have connected to the Vantage system, Power BI Desktop remembers the credentials for future connections to the system. You can modify these credentials by going to File > Options and settings > Data source settings. The Navigator window appears after a successful connection. It displays the data available on the Vantage system. You can select one or more elements to use in Power BI Desktop. You preview a table by clicking on its name. If you want to load it into Power BI Desktop, ensure that you click the checkbox next to the table name. You can Load the selected table, which brings it into Power BI Desktop. You can also Edit the query, which opens a query editor so you can filter and refine the set of data you want to load. Edit may be called Transform data, depending upon the version of Power BI Desktop that you have. For information on joining tables, see Create and Manage Relationships in Power BI Desktop feature. To publish your report, click Publish on Home ribbon in Power BI Desktop. Power BI Desktop will prompt you to save your report. Choose My workspace and click Select. Once report has been published, click Got it to close. You may also click the link, which has the report name in the link. This is an example of a report created in Power BI Desktop. You can combine data from many sources with Power BI Desktop. Look at the following links for more information. What is Power BI Desktop? Data Sources in Power BI Desktop Shape and Combine Data with Power BI Desktop Connect to Excel workbooks in Power BI Desktop Enter data directly into Power BI Desktop If you have any questions or need further assistance, please visit our community forum where you can get support and interact with other community members.

We will create and use a storage account and data share account for both users. This is a diagram of the workflow. Azure Data Share enables organizations to simply and securely share data with multiple customers and partners. Both the data provider and data consumer must have an Azure subscription to share and receive data. Azure Data Share currently offers snapshot-based sharing and in-place sharing. Today, Azure Data Share supported data stores include Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Data Explorer. Once a dataset share has been sent using Azure Data Share, the data consumer is able to receive that data in a data store of their choice like Azure Blob Storage and then use Teradata Vantage to explore and analyze the data. For more information see documentation. Vantage is the modern cloud platform that unifies data warehouses, data lakes, and analytics into a single connected ecosystem. Vantage combines descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytics, autonomous decision-making, ML functions, and visualization tools into a unified, integrated platform that uncovers real-time business intelligence at scale, no matter where the data resides. Vantage enables companies to start small and elastically scale compute or storage, paying only for what they use, harnessing low-cost object stores and integrating their analytic workloads. Vantage supports R, Python, Teradata Studio, and any other SQL-based tools. You can deploy Vantage across public clouds, on-premises, on optimized or commodity infrastructure, or as-a-service. Teradata Vantage Native Object Store (NOS) can be used to explore data in external object stores, like Azure Blob Storage, using standard SQL. No special object storage-side compute infrastructure is required to use NOS. You can explore data located in an Blob Storage container by simply creating a NOS table definition that points to your container. With NOS, you can quickly import data from Blob Storage or even join it other tables in the database. Alternatively, the Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) utility can be used to import data from Blob Storage to Teradata Vantage in bulk fashion. Once loaded, data can be efficiently queried within Vantage. For more information see documentation. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. An Azure account. You can start with a free account. An Azure Blob Storage account to store the dataset Once you have met the prerequisites, follow these steps: Create a Azure Blob Storage account and container Create a Data Share Account Create a share Accept and receive data using Data Share Configure NOS access to Blob Storage Query the dataset in Blob Storage Load data from Blob Storage into Vantage (optional) Open the Azure portal in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari work well) and follow the steps in create a storage account in a resource group called myProviderStorage_rg in this article. Enter a storage name and connectivity method. We will use myproviderstorage and public endpoint in this article. We suggest that you use the same location for all services you create. Select Review + create, then Create. Go to resource and click Containers to create container. Click the + Container button. Enter a container name. We will use providerdata in this article. Click Create. We will create a Data Share account for the provider sharing the dataset. Follow the Create an Azure Data Share Account steps to create resource in a resource group called myDataShareProvider_rg in this article. In Basics tab, enter a data share account name. We will use mydatashareprovider in this article. We suggest that you use the same location for all services you create. Select Review + create, then Create. When the deployment is complete, select Go to resource. Navigate to your Data Share Overview page and follow the steps in Create a share. Select Start sharing your data. Select + Create. In Details tab, enter a share name and share type. We will use WeatherData and Snapshot in this article. Snapshot share Choose snapshot sharing to provide copy of the data to the recipient. Supported data store: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL DW) In-place share Choose in-place sharing to provide access to data at its source. Supported data store: Azure Data Explorer Click Continue. In Datasets tab, click Add datasets Select Azure Blob Storage Click Next. Enter Storage account providing the dataset. We will use myproviderstorage in this article. Click Next. Double-click container to choose the dataset. We will use providerdata and onpoint_history_postal-code_hour.csv file in this article. Figure 6 Select Storage container and dataset Azure Data Share can share at the folder and file level. Use Azure Blob Storage resource to upload a file. Click Next. Enter a Dataset name that the consumer will see for the folder and dataset. We will use the default names but delete the providerdata folder this article. Click Add datasets. Click Add datasets. Click Continue. In Recipients tab, click Add recipient email address to send share notification. Enter email address for consumer. Set Share expiration for amount of time share is valid for consumer to accept. Click Continue. In Settings tab, set Snapshot schedule. We use default unchecked this article. Click Continue. In Review + Create tab, click Create. Your Azure Data Share has now been created and the recipient of your Data Share is now ready to accept your invitation. In this article, the recipient/consumer is going to receive the data into their Azure Blob storage account. Similar to the Data Share Provider, ensure that all pre-requisites are complete for the Consumer before accepting a data share invitation. Azure Subscription: If you don’t have one, create a https://azure.microsoft.com/free/[free account] before you begin. Azure Blob Storage account and container: create resource group called myConsumerStorage_rg and create account name myconsumerstorage and container consumerdata. Azure Data Share account: create resource group called myDataShareConsumer_rg and create a data share account name called mydatashareconsumer to accept the data. Follow the steps in Accept and receive data using Azure Data Share. In your email, an invitation from Microsoft Azure with a subject titled \"Azure Data Share invitation from yourdataprovider@domain.com. Click on the View invitation to see your invitation in Azure. This action opens your browser to the list of Data Share invitations. Select the share you would like to view. We will select WeatherData in this article. Under Target Data Share Account, select the Subscription and Resource Group that you would like to deployed your Data Share into or you can create a new Data Share here. f provider required a Terms of Use acceptance, a dialog box would appear and you’ll be required to check the box to indicate you agree to the terms of use. Enter the Resource group and Data share account. We will use myDataShareConsumer_rg and mydatashareconsumer account this article. Select Accept and configure and a share subscription will be created. Select Datasets tab. Check the box next to the dataset you’d like to assign a destination to. Select + Map to target to choose a target data store. Select a target data store type and path that you’d like the data to land in. We will use consumers Azure Blob Storage account myconsumerstorage and container consumerdata for our snapshot example in this article. Azure Data Share provides open and flexible data sharing, including the ability to share from and to different data stores. Check supported data sources that can accept snapshot and in place sharing. Click on Map to target. Once mapping is complete, for snapshot-based sharing click on Details tab and click Trigger snapshot for Full or Incremental. We will select full copy since this is your first time receiving data from your provider. When the last run status is successful, go to target data store to view the received data. Select Datasets, and click on the link in the Target Path. Native Object Store (NOS) can directly read data in Azure Blob Storage, which allows you to explore and analyze data in Blob Storage without explicitly loading the data. A foreign table definition allows data in Blob Storage to be easily referenced within the Advanced SQL Engine and makes the data available in a structured, relational format. NOS supports data in CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats. Login to your Vantage system with Teradata Studio. Create an AUTHORIZATION object to access your Blob Storage container with the following SQL command. CREATE AUTHORIZATION DefAuth_AZ AS DEFINER TRUSTED USER 'myconsumerstorage' /* Storage Account Name */ PASSWORD '*****************' /* Storage Account Access Key or SAS Token */ Replace the string for USER with your Storage Account Name. Replace the string for PASSWORD with your Storage Account Access Key or SAS Token. Create a foreign table definition for the CSV file on Blob Storage with the following SQL command. CREATE MULTISET FOREIGN TABLE WeatherData, EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER TRUSTED DefAuth_AZ ( Location VARCHAR(2048) CHARACTER SET UNICODE CASESPECIFIC, Payload DATASET INLINE LENGTH 64000 STORAGE FORMAT CSV ) USING ( LOCATION ('/AZ/myconsumerstorage.blob.core.windows.net/consumerdata/') ) At a minimum, the foreign table definition must include a table name (WeatherData) and a location clause, which points to the object store data. The LOCATION requires a storage account name and container name. You will need to replace this with your own storage account and container name. If the object doesn’t have a standard extension (e.g. “.json”, “.csv”, “.parquet”), then the Location…Payload columns definition phrase is also needed, and the LOCATION phase need to include the file name. For example: LOCATION (AZ/.blob.core.windows.net//). Foreign tables are always defined as No Primary Index (NoPI) tables. Run the following SQL command to query the dataset. SELECT * FROM WeatherData SAMPLE 10; The foreign table only contains two columns: Location and Payload. Location is the address in the object store system. The data itself is represented in the payload column, with the payload value within each record in the foreign table representing a single CSV row. Run the following SQL command to focus on the data in the object. SELECT payload..* FROM WeatherData SAMPLE 10; Views can simplify the names associated with the payload attributes, can make it easier to code SQL against the object data, and can hide the Location references in the foreign table. Vantage foreign tables use the .. (double dot or double period) operator to separate the object name from the column name. Run the following SQL command to create a view. REPLACE VIEW WeatherData_view AS ( SELECT CAST(payload..postal_code AS VARCHAR(10)) Postal_code, CAST(payload..country AS CHAR(2)) Country, CAST(payload..time_valid_utc AS TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS') Time_Valid_UTC, CAST(payload..doy_utc AS INTEGER) DOY_UTC, CAST(payload..hour_utc AS INTEGER) Hour_UTC, CAST(payload..time_valid_lcl AS TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS') Time_Valid_LCL, CAST(payload..dst_offset_minutes AS INTEGER) DST_Offset_Minutes, CAST(payload..temperature_air_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Air_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_wetbulb_2m_f AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Temperature_Wetbulb_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_dewpoint_2m_f AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Temperature_Dewpoint_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_feelslike_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Feelslike_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_windchill_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Windchill_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_heatindex_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Heatindex_2M_F, CAST(payload..humidity_relative_2m_pct AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Humidity_Relative_2M_Pct, CAST(payload..humidity_specific_2m_gpkg AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Humdity_Specific_2M_GPKG, CAST(payload..pressure_2m_mb AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Pressure_2M_Mb, CAST(payload..pressure_tendency_2m_mb AS DECIMAL(2,1)) Pressure_Tendency_2M_Mb, CAST(payload..pressure_mean_sea_level_mb AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Pressure_Mean_Sea_Level_Mb, CAST(payload..wind_speed_10m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_10M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_10m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_10M_Deg, CAST(payload..wind_speed_80m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_80M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_80m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_80M_Deg, CAST(payload..wind_speed_100m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_100M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_100m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_100M_Deg, CAST(payload..precipitation_in AS DECIMAL(3,2)) Precipitation_in, CAST(payload..snowfall_in AS DECIMAL(3,2)) Snowfall_in, CAST(payload..cloud_cover_pct AS INTEGER) Cloud_Cover_Pct, CAST(payload..radiation_solar_total_wpm2 AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Radiation_Solar_Total_WPM2 FROM WeatherData ) Run the following SQL command to validate the view. SELECT * FROM WeatherData_view SAMPLE 10; Now that you have created a view, you can easily reference the object store data in a query and combine it with other tables, both relational tables in Vantage as well as foreign tables in an object store. This allows you to leverage the full analytic capabilities of Vantage on 100% of the data, no matter where the data is located. Having a persistent copy of the Blob Storage data can be useful when repetitive access of the same data is expected. NOS does not automatically make a persistent copy of the Blob Storage data. Each time you reference a foreign table, Vantage will fetch the data from Blob Storage. (Some data may be cached, but this depends on the size of the data in Blob Storage and other active workloads in Vantage.) In addition, you may be charged network fees for data transferred from Blob Storage. If you will be referencing the data in Blob Storage multiple times, you may reduce your cost by loading it into Vantage, even temporarily. You can select among the approaches below to load the data into Vantage. You can use a single statement to both create the table and load the data. You can choose the desired attributes from the foreign table payload and what they will be called in the relational table. A CREATE TABLE AS … WITH DATA statement can be used with the foreign table definition as the source table. Run the following SQL command to create the relational table and load the data. CREATE MULTISET TABLE WeatherData_temp AS ( SELECT CAST(payload..postal_code AS VARCHAR(10)) Postal_code, CAST(payload..country AS CHAR(2)) Country, CAST(payload..time_valid_utc AS TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS') Time_Valid_UTC, CAST(payload..doy_utc AS INTEGER) DOY_UTC, CAST(payload..hour_utc AS INTEGER) Hour_UTC, CAST(payload..time_valid_lcl AS TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS') Time_Valid_LCL, CAST(payload..dst_offset_minutes AS INTEGER) DST_Offset_Minutes, CAST(payload..temperature_air_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Air_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_wetbulb_2m_f AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Temperature_Wetbulb_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_dewpoint_2m_f AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Temperature_Dewpoint_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_feelslike_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Feelslike_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_windchill_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Windchill_2M_F, CAST(payload..temperature_heatindex_2m_f AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Temperature_Heatindex_2M_F, CAST(payload..humidity_relative_2m_pct AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Humidity_Relative_2M_Pct, CAST(payload..humidity_specific_2m_gpkg AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Humdity_Specific_2M_GPKG, CAST(payload..pressure_2m_mb AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Pressure_2M_Mb, CAST(payload..pressure_tendency_2m_mb AS DECIMAL(2,1)) Pressure_Tendency_2M_Mb, CAST(payload..pressure_mean_sea_level_mb AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Pressure_Mean_Sea_Level_Mb, CAST(payload..wind_speed_10m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_10M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_10m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_10M_Deg, CAST(payload..wind_speed_80m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_80M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_80m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_80M_Deg, CAST(payload..wind_speed_100m_mph AS DECIMAL(3,1)) Wind_Speed_100M_MPH, CAST(payload..wind_direction_100m_deg AS DECIMAL(4,1)) Wind_Direction_100M_Deg, CAST(payload..precipitation_in AS DECIMAL(3,2)) Precipitation_in, CAST(payload..snowfall_in AS DECIMAL(3,2)) Snowfall_in, CAST(payload..cloud_cover_pct AS INTEGER) Cloud_Cover_Pct, CAST(payload..radiation_solar_total_wpm2 AS DECIMAL(5,1)) Radiation_Solar_Total_WPM2 FROM WeatherData WHERE Postal_Code = '36101' ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX Run the following SQL command to validate the contents of the table. SELECT * FROM WeatherData_temp SAMPLE 10; You can also use multiple statements to first create the relational table and then load the data. An advantage of this choice is that you can perform multiple loads, possibly selecting different data or loading in smaller increments if the object is very large. Run the following SQL command to create the relational table. CREATE MULTISET TABLE WeatherData_temp ( Postal_code VARCHAR(10), Country CHAR(2), Time_Valid_UTC TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS', DOY_UTC INTEGER, Hour_UTC INTEGER, Time_Valid_LCL TIMESTAMP(0) FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DDBHH:MI:SS', DST_Offset_Minutes INTEGER, Temperature_Air_2M_F DECIMAL(4,1), Temperature_Wetbulb_2M_F DECIMAL(3,1), Temperature_Dewpoint_2M_F DECIMAL(3,1), Temperature_Feelslike_2M_F DECIMAL(4,1), Temperature_Windchill_2M_F DECIMAL(4,1), Temperature_Heatindex_2M_F DECIMAL(4,1), Humidity_Relative_2M_Pct DECIMAL(3,1), Humdity_Specific_2M_GPKG DECIMAL(3,1), Pressure_2M_Mb DECIMAL(5,1), Pressure_Tendency_2M_Mb DECIMAL(2,1), Pressure_Mean_Sea_Level_Mb DECIMAL(5,1), Wind_Speed_10M_MPH DECIMAL(3,1), Wind_Direction_10M_Deg DECIMAL(4,1), Wind_Speed_80M_MPH DECIMAL(3,1), Wind_Direction_80M_Deg DECIMAL(4,1), Wind_Speed_100M_MPH DECIMAL(3,1), Wind_Direction_100M_Deg DECIMAL(4,1), Precipitation_in DECIMAL(3,2), Snowfall_in DECIMAL(3,2), Cloud_Cover_Pct INTEGER, Radiation_Solar_Total_WPM2 DECIMAL(5,1) ) UNIQUE PRIMARY INDEX ( Postal_Code, Time_Valid_UTC ) Run the following SQL to load the data into the table.

SELECT * FROM WeatherData_temp SAMPLE 10; An alternative to defining a foreign table is to use the READ_NOS table operator. This table operator allows you to access data directly from an object store without first creating a foreign table, or to view a list of the keys associated with all the objects specified by a Location clause. You can use the READ_NOS table operator to explore the data in an object. Run the following command to explore the data in an object. SELECT TOP 5 payload..* FROM READ_NOS ( ON (SELECT CAST( NULL AS DATASET STORAGE FORMAT CSV)) USING LOCATION ('/AZ/myconsumerstorage.blob.core.windows.net/consumerdata') ACCESS_ID('myconsumerstorage') ACCESS_KEY('*****') ) AS THE_TABLE ORDER BY 1 The LOCATION requires a storage account name and container name. This is highlighted above in yellow. You will need to replace this with your own storage account and container name. Replace the string for ACCESS_ID with your Storage Account Name. Replace the string for ACCES_KEY with your Storage Account Access Key or SAS Token You can also leverage the READ_NOS table operator to get the length (size) of the object. Run the following SQL command to view the size of the object. SELECT location(CHAR(120)), ObjectLength FROM READ_NOS ( ON (SELECT CAST( NULL AS DATASET STORAGE FORMAT CSV)) USING LOCATION ('/AZ/myconsumerstorage.blob.core.windows.net/consumerdata') ACCESS_ID('myconsumerstorage') ACCESS_KEY('*****') RETURNTYPE('NOSREAD_KEYS') ) AS THE_TABLE ORDER BY 1 Replace the values for LOCATION, ACCESS_ID, and ACCESS_KEY. You can substitute the NOS_READ table operator for a foreign table definition in the above section for loading the data into a relational table.

A hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks integrated with Teradata Extensions and analytics tools is available for functional testing for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Teradata Jupyter extensions provide Teradata SQL kernel and several UI extensions to allow users to easily access and navigate Teradata database from Jupyter envioronment. Google Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s new unified ML platform. Vertex AI Workbench provides a Jupyter-base development environment for the entire data science workflow. This article describes how to integate our Jupyter extensions with Vertex AI Workbench so that Vertex AI users can take advantage of our Teradata extensions in their ML pipeline. Vertex AI workbench supports two types of notebooks: managed notebooks and user-managed notebooks. Here we will focus on user-managed notebooks. We will show two ways to integrate our Jupyter extensions with user-managed notebooks: use startup script to install our kernel and extensions or use custom container. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Google Cloud account with Vertex AI enabled Google cloud storage to store startup scripts and Teradata Jupyter extension package There are two ways to run Teradata Jupyter Extensions in Vertex AI: Use startup script Use custom container These two integration methods are described below. When we create a new notebook instance, we can specify a startup script. This script runs only once after the instance is created. Here are the steps: Download Teradata Jupyter extensions package Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page to download the Teradata Jupyter extensions package bundle Linux version. Upload the package to a Google Cloud storage bucket Write a startup script and upload it to cloud storage bucket Below is a sample script. It fetches Teradata Jupyter extension package from cloud storage bucket and installs Teradata SQL kernel and extensions. #! /bin/bash cd /home/jupyter mkdir teradata cd teradata gsutil cp gs://teradata-jupyter/* . unzip teradatasql*.zip # Install Teradata kernel cp teradatakernel /usr/local/bin jupyter kernelspec install ./teradatasql --prefix=/opt/conda # Install Teradata extensions pip install --find-links . teradata_preferences_prebuilt pip install --find-links . teradata_connection_manager_prebuilt pip install --find-links . teradata_sqlhighlighter_prebuilt pip install --find-links . teradata_resultset_renderer_prebuilt pip install --find-links . teradata_database_explorer_prebuilt # PIP install the Teradata Python library pip install teradataml # Install Teradata R library (optional, uncomment this line only if you use an environment that supports R) #Rscript -e \"install.packages('tdplyr',repos=c('https://r-repo.teradata.com','https://cloud.r-project.org'))\" Create a new notebook and add the startup script from cloud storage bucket It may take a few minutes for the notebook creation process to complete. When it is done, click on Open notebook. Another option is to provide a custom container when creating a notebook. Download Teradata Jupyter extensions package Go to Vantage Modules for Jupyter page to download the Teradata Jupyter extensions package bundle Linux version. Copy this package to your work directory and unzip it Build custom Docker image The custom container must expose a service on port 8080. It is recommended to create a container derived from a Google Deep Learning Containers image, because those images are already configured to be compatible with user-managed notebooks. Below is a sample Dockerfile you can use to build a Docker image with Teradata SQL kernel and extensions installed: # Use one of the deep learning images as base image # if you need both Python and R, use one of the R images FROM gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/r-cpu:latest USER root ############################################################## # Install kernel and copy supporting files ############################################################## # Copy the kernel COPY ./teradatakernel /usr/local/bin RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/teradatakernel # Copy directory with kernel.json file into image COPY ./teradatasql teradatasql/ # Copy notebooks and licenses COPY ./notebooks/ /home/jupyter COPY ./license.txt /home/jupyter COPY ./ThirdPartyLicenses/ /home/jupyter # Install the kernel file to /opt/conda jupyter lab instance RUN jupyter kernelspec install ./teradatasql --prefix=/opt/conda ############################################################## # Install Teradata extensions ############################################################## RUN pip install --find-links . teradata_preferences_prebuilt && \\ pip install --find-links . teradata_connection_manager_prebuilt && \\ pip install --find-links . teradata_sqlhighlighter_prebuilt && \\ pip install --find-links . teradata_resultset_renderer_prebuilt && \\ pip install --find-links . teradata_database_explorer_prebuilt # Give back ownership of /opt/conda to jovyan RUN chown -R jupyter:users /opt/conda # PIP install the Teradata Python libraries RUN pip install teradataml # Install Teradata R library (optional, include it only if you use a base image that supports R) RUN Rscript -e \"install.packages('tdplyr',repos=c('https://r-repo.teradata.com','https://cloud.r-project.org'))\" In your work directory (where you unzipped Teradata Jupyter extensions package), run docker build to build the image: docker build -f Dockerfile imagename:imagetag .

AWS account AWS S3 bucket to store lifecycle configuration scripts and Teradata Jupyter extension package SageMaker supports customization of notebook instances using lifecycle configuration scripts. Below we will demo how to use lifecycle configuration scripts to install our Jupyter kernel and extensions in a notebook instance. Download Teradata Jupyter extensions package Download Linux version from https://downloads.teradata.com/download/tools/vantage-modules-for-jupyter and upload it to an S3 bucket. This zipped package contains Teradata Jupyter kernel and extensions. Each extension has 2 files, the one with \"_prebuilt\" in the name is prebuilt extension which can be installed using PIP, the other one is source extension that needs to be installed using \"jupyter labextension\". It is recommended to use prebuilt extensions. Create a lifecycle configuration for notebook instance Here are sample scripts that fetches the Teradata package from S3 bucket and installs Jupyter kernel and extensions.

It contains two use cases: Retrieve customer information from Salesforce, and combine it with order and shipping information from Vantage to derive analytical insights. Update newleads table on Vantage with the Salesforce data, then add the new lead(s) back to Salesforce using AppFlow. Amazon AppFlow transfers the customer account data from Salesforce to Amazon S3. Vantage then uses Native Object Store (NOS) read functionality to join the data in Amazon S3 with data in Vantage with a single query. The account information is used to update the newleads table on Vantage. Once the table is updated, Vantage writes it back to the Amazon S3 bucket with NOS Write. A Lambda function is triggered upon arrival of the new lead data file to convert the data file from Parquet format to CSV format, and AppFlow then inserts the new lead(s) back into Salesforce. Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables users to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats. As of today, Amazon AppFlow has 16 sources to choose from, and can send the data to four destinations. Teradata Vantage is the connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics, solving data challenges from start to scale. Vantage enables companies to start small and elastically scale compute or storage, paying only for what they use, harnessing low-cost object stores and integrating their analytic workloads. Vantage supports R, Python, Teradata Studio, and any other SQL-based tools. Vantage combines descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytics, autonomous decision-making, ML functions, and visualization tools into a unified, integrated platform that uncovers real-time business intelligence at scale, no matter where the data resides. Teradata Vantage Native Object Store (NOS) can be used to explore data in external object stores, like Amazon S3, using standard SQL. No special object storage-side compute infrastructure is required to use NOS. Users can explore data located in an Amazon S3 bucket by simply creating a NOS table definition that points to your bucket. With NOS, you can quickly import data from Amazon S3 or even join it with other tables in the Vantage database. You are expected to be familiar with Amazon AppFlow service and Teradata Vantage. You will need the following accounts, and systems: Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. An AWS account with the role that can create and run flows. An Amazon S3 bucket to store Salesforce data (i.e., ptctsoutput) An Amazon S3 bucket to store raw Vantage data (Parquet file) (i.e., vantageparquet). This bucket needs to have policy to allow Amazon AppFlow access An Amazon S3 bucket to store converted Vantage data (CSV file) (i.e., vantagecsv) A Salesforce account that satisfies the following requirements: Your Salesforce account must be enabled for API access. API access is enabled by default for Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance editions. Your Salesforce account must allow you to install connected apps. If this is disabled, contact your Salesforce administrator. After you create a Salesforce connection in Amazon AppFlow, verify that the connected app named \"Amazon AppFlow Embedded Login App\" is installed in your Salesforce account. The refresh token policy for the \"Amazon AppFlow Embedded Login App\" must be set to \"Refresh token is valid until revoked\". Otherwise, your flows will fail when your refresh token expires. You must enable Change Data Capture in Salesforce to use event-driven flow triggers. From Setup, enter \"Change Data Capture\" in Quick Find. If your Salesforce app enforces IP address restrictions, you must whitelist the addresses used by Amazon AppFlow. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html[AWS IP address ranges] in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. If you are transferring over 1 million Salesforce records, you cannot choose any Salesforce compound field. Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk APIs for the transfer, which does not allow transfer of compound fields. To create private connections using AWS PrivateLink, you must enable both \"Manager Metadata\" and \"Manage External Connections\" user permissions in your Salesforce account. Private connections are currently available in the us-east-1 and us-west-2 AWS Regions. Some Salesforce objects can’t be updated, such as history objects. For these objects, Amazon AppFlow does not support incremental export (the \"Transfer new data only\" option) for schedule-triggered flows. Instead, you can choose the \"Transfer all data\" option and then select the appropriate filter to limit the records you transfer. Once you have met the prerequisites, follow these steps: Create a Salesforce to Amazon S3 Flow Exploring Data using NOS Export Vantage Data to Amazon S3 using NOS Create an Amazon S3 to Salesforce Flow This step creates a flow using Amazon AppFlow. For this example, we’re using a Salesforce developer account to connect to Salesforce. Go to AppFlow console, sign in with your AWS login credentials and click Create flow. Make sure you are in the right region, and the bucket is created to store Salesforce data. This step provides basic information for your flow. Fill in Flow name (i.e. salesforce) and Flow description (optional), leave Customize encryption settings (advanced) unchecked. Click Next. This step provides information about the source and destination for your flow. For this example, we will be using Salesforce as the source, and Amazon S3 as the destination. For Source name, choose Salesforce, then Create new connection for Choose Salesforce connection. Use default for Salesforce environment and Data encryption. Give your connection a name (i.e. salesforce) and click Continue. At the salesforce login window, enter your Username and Password. Click Log In Click Allow to allow AppFlow to access your salesforce data and information. Back at the AppFlow Configure flow window, use Salesforce objects, and choose Account to be the Salesforce object. Use Amazon S3 as Destination name. Pick the bucket you created earlier where you want the data to be stored (i.e., ptctsoutput). Flow trigger is Run on demand. Click Next. This step determines how data is transferred from the source to the destination. Use Manually map fields as Mapping method For simplicity, choose Map all fields directly for Source to destination filed mapping. Once you click on \"Map all fields directly\", all the fields will show under Mapped fields. Click on the checkbox for the field(s) you want to Add formula (concatenates), Modify values (mask or truncate field values), or Remove selected mappings. For this example, no checkbox will be ticked. For Validations, add in a condition to ignore the record that contains no \"Billing Address\" (optional). Click Next. You can specify a filter to determine which records to transfer. For this example, add a condition to filter out the records that are deleted (optional). Click Next. Review all the information you just entered. Modify if necessary. Click Create flow. A message of successful flow creation will be displayed with the flow information once the flow is created, Click Run flow on the upper right corner. Upon completion of the flow run, message will be displayed to indicate a successful run. Message example: Click the link to the bucket to view data. Salesforce data will be in JSON format. By default, Salesforce data is encrypted. We need to remove the encryption for NOS to access it. Click on the data file in your Amazon S3 bucket, then click the Properties tab. Click on the AWS-KMS from Encryption and change it from AWS-KMS encryption to None. Click Save. Native Object Store has built in functionalities to explore and analyze data in Amazon S3. This section lists a few commonly used functions of NOS. Foreign table allows the external data to be easily referenced within the Vantage Advanced SQL Engine and makes the data available in a structured relational format. To create a foreign table, first login to Teradata Vantage system with your credentials. Create AUTHORIZATION object with access keys for Amazon S3 bucket access. Authorization object enhances security by establishing control over who is allowed to use a foreign table to access Amazon S3 data. CREATE AUTHORIZATION DefAuth_S3 AS DEFINER TRUSTED USER 'A*****************' /* AccessKeyId */ PASSWORD '********'; /* SecretAccessKey */ \"USER\" is the AccessKeyId for your AWS account, and \"PASSWORD\" is the SecretAccessKey. Create a foreign table against the JSON file on Amazon S3 using following command. CREATE MULTISET FOREIGN TABLE salesforce, EXTERNAL SECURITY DEFINER TRUSTED DefAuth_S3 ( Location VARCHAR(2048) CHARACTER SET UNICODE CASESPECIFIC, Payload JSON(8388096) INLINE LENGTH 32000 CHARACTER SET UNICODE ) USING ( LOCATION ('/S3/s3.amazonaws.com/ptctstoutput/salesforce/1ce190bc-25a9-4493-99ad-7497b497a0d0/903790813-2020-08-21T21:02:25') ); At a minimum, the foreign table definition must include a table name and location clause (highlighted in yellow) which points to the object store data. The Location requires a top-level single name, referred to as a \"bucket\" in Amazon. If the file name doesn’t have standard extension (.json, .csv, .parquet) at the end, the Location and Payload columns definition is also required (highlighted in turquoise) to indicate the type of the data file. Foreign tables are always defined as No Primary Index (NoPI) tables. Once foreign table’s created, you can query the content of the Amazon S3 data set by doing \"Select\" on the foreign table. SELECT * FROM salesforce; SELECT payload.* FROM salesforce; The foreign table only contains two columns: Location and Payload. Location is the address in the object store system. The data itself is represented in the payload column, with the payload value within each record in the foreign table representing a single JSON object and all its name-value pairs. Sample output from \"SELECT * FROM salesforce;\". Sample output form \"SELECT payload.* FROM salesforce;\". JSON data may contain different attributes in different records. To determine the full list of possible attributes in a data store, use JSON_KEYS: |SELECT DISTINCT * FROM JSON_KEYS (ON (SELECT payload FROM salesforce)) AS j; Partial Output: Views can simplify the names associated with the payload attributes, make it easier to code executable SQL against object store data, and hide the Location references in the foreign table to make it look like normal columns. Following is a sample create view statement with the attributes discovered from the JSON_KEYS table operator above. REPLACE VIEW salesforceView AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS VARCHAR(10)) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS VARCHAR(50)) Last_Activity_Date FROM salesforce ); SELECT * FROM salesforceView; Partial output: READ_NOS table operator can be used to sample and explore a percent of the data without having first defined a foreign table, or to view a list of the keys associated with all the objects specified by a Location clause.

For example, ordering and shipping information are in Vantage in these three tables – Orders, Order_Items and Shipping_Address. DDL for Orders: CREATE TABLE Orders ( Order_ID INT NOT NULL, Customer_ID VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Order_Status INT, -- Order status: 1 = Pending; 2 = Processing; 3 = Rejected; 4 = Completed Order_Date DATE NOT NULL, Required_Date DATE NOT NULL, Shipped_Date DATE, Store_ID INT NOT NULL, Staff_ID INT NOT NULL ) Primary Index (Order_ID); DDL for Order_Items: CREATE TABLE Order_Items( Order_ID INT NOT NULL, Item_ID INT, Product_ID INT NOT NULL, Quantity INT NOT NULL, List_Price DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL, Discount DECIMAL (4, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 ) Primary Index (Order_ID, Item_ID); DDL for Shipping_Address: CREATE TABLE Shipping_Address ( Customer_ID VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC NOT NULL, Street VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, City VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, State VARCHAR(15) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Postal_Code VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC, Country VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN CASESPECIFIC ) Primary Index (Customer_ID); And the tables have following data: Orders: Order_Items: Shipping_Address: By joining the salesforce foreign table to the established database table Orders, Order_Items and Shipping_Address, we can retrieve customer’s order information with customer’s shipping information. SELECT s.payload.Id as Customer_ID, s.payload.\"Name\" as Customer_Name, s.payload.AccountNumber as Acct_Number, o.Order_ID as Order_ID, o.Order_Status as Order_Status, o.Order_Date as Order_Date, oi.Item_ID as Item_ID, oi.Product_ID as Product_ID, sa.Street as Shipping_Street, sa.City as Shipping_City, sa.State as Shipping_State, sa.Postal_Code as Shipping_Postal_Code, sa.Country as Shipping_Country FROM salesforce s, Orders o, Order_Items oi, Shipping_Address sa WHERE s.payload.Id = o.Customer_ID AND o.Customer_ID = sa.Customer_ID AND o.Order_ID = oi.Order_ID ORDER BY 1; Results: Having a persistent copy of the Amazon S3 data can be useful when repetitive access of the same data is expected. NOS foreign table does not automatically make a persistent copy of the Amazon S3 data. A few approaches to capture the data in the database are described below: A \"CREATE TABLE AS … WITH DATA\" statement can be used with the foreign table definition acting as the source table. Use this approach you can selectively choose which attributes within the foreign table payload that you want to include in the target table, and what the relational table columns will be named. CREATE TABLE salesforceVantage AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS INT) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS DATE) Last_Activity_Date FROM salesforce) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; SELECT* * FROM salesforceVantage; partial results: An alternative to using foreign table is to use the READ_NOS table operator. This table operator allows you to access data directly from an object store without first building a foreign table. Combining READ_NOS with a CREATE TABLE AS clause to build a persistent version of the data in the database. CREATE TABLE salesforceReadNOS AS ( SELECT CAST(payload.Id AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_ID, CAST(payload.\"Name\" AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Name, CAST(payload.AccountNumber AS VARCHAR(10)) Acct_Number, CAST(payload.BillingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Street, CAST(payload.BillingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_City, CAST(payload.BillingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Billing_State, CAST(payload.BillingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Billing_Post_Code, CAST(payload.BillingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Billing_Country, CAST(payload.Phone AS VARCHAR(15)) Phone, CAST(payload.Fax AS VARCHAR(15)) Fax, CAST(payload.ShippingStreet AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Street, CAST(payload.ShippingCity AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_City, CAST(payload.ShippingState AS VARCHAR(10)) Shipping_State, CAST(payload.ShippingPostalCode AS VARCHAR(5)) Shipping_Post_Code, CAST(payload.ShippingCountry AS VARCHAR(20)) Shipping_Country, CAST(payload.Industry AS VARCHAR(50)) Industry, CAST(payload.Description AS VARCHAR(200)) Description, CAST(payload.NumberOfEmployees AS INT) Num_Of_Employee, CAST(payload.CustomerPriority__c AS VARCHAR(10)) Priority, CAST(payload.Rating AS VARCHAR(10)) Rating, CAST(payload.SLA__c AS VARCHAR(10)) SLA, CAST(payload.\"Type\" AS VARCHAR(20)) Customer_Type, CAST(payload.Website AS VARCHAR(100)) Customer_Website, CAST(payload.AnnualRevenue AS VARCHAR(10)) Annual_Revenue, CAST(payload.LastActivityDate AS DATE) Last_Activity_Date FROM READ_NOS ( ON (SELECT CAST(NULL AS JSON CHARACTER SET Unicode)) USING LOCATION ('/S3/s3.amazonaws.com/ptctstoutput/salesforce/1ce190bc-25a9-4493-99ad-7497b497a0d0/903790813-2020-08-21T21:02:25') ACCESS_ID ('A**********') /* AccessKeyId */ ACCESS_KEY ('***********') /* SecretAccessKey */ ) AS D ) WITH DATA; Results from the salesforceReadNOS table: SELECT * FROM salesforceReadNOS; Another way of placing Amazon S3 data into a relational table is by \"INSERT SELECT\". Using this approach, the foreign table is the source table, while a newly created permanent table is the table to be inserted into. Contrary to the READ_NOS example above, this approach does require the permanent table be created beforehand. One advantage of the INSERT SELECT method is that you can change the target table’s attributes. For example, you can specify that the target table be MULTISET or not, or you can choose a different primary index.

Repeat Step 1 to create a flow using Amazon S3 as source and Salesforce as destination. This step provides basic information for your flow. Fill in Flow name (i.e., vantage2sf) and Flow description (optional), leave Customize encryption settings (advanced) unchecked. Click Next. This step provides information about the source and destination for your flow. For this example, we will be using Amazon S3 as the source, and Salesforce as the destination. For Source details, choose Amazon S3, then choose the bucket where you wrote your CSV file to (i.e. vantagecsv) For Destination details, choose Salesforce, use the connection you created in Step 1 from the drop-down list for Choose Salesforce connection, and Lead as Choose Salesforce object. For Error handling, use the default Stop the current flow run. Flow trigger is Run on demand. Click Next. This step determines how data is transferred from the source to the destination. Use Manually map fields as Mapping method Use Insert new records (default) as Destination record preference For Source to destination filed mapping, use the following mapping Click Next. You can specify a filter to determine which records to transfer. For this example, no filter is added. Click Next. Review all the information you just entered. Modify if necessary. Click Create flow. A message of successful flow creation will be displayed with the flow information once the flow is created, Click Run flow on the upper right corner.

The approach this guide explains is one of many potential approaches to integrate with the service. Amazon SageMaker provides a fully managed Machine Learning Platform. There are two use cases for Amazon SageMaker and Teradata: Data resides on Teradata Vantage and Amazon SageMaker will be used for both the Model definition and subsequent scoring. Under this use case Teradata will provide data into the Amazon S3 environment so that Amazon SageMaker can consume training and test data sets for the purpose of model development. Teradata would further make data available via Amazon S3 for subsequent scoring by Amazon SageMaker. Under this model Teradata is a data repository only. Data resides on Teradata Vantage and Amazon SageMaker will be used for the Model definition, and Teradata for the subsequent scoring. Under this use case Teradata will provide data into the Amazon S3 environment so that Amazon SageMaker can consume training and test data sets for the purpose of model development. Teradata will need to import the Amazon SageMaker model into a Teradata table for subsequent scoring by Teradata Vantage. Under this model Teradata is a data repository and a scoring engine. The first use case is discussed in this document. Amazon SageMaker consumes training and test data from an Amazon S3 bucket. This article describes how you can load Teradata analytics data sets into an Amazon S3 bucket. The data can then available to Amazon SageMaker to build and train machine learning models and deploy them into a production environment. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. IAM permission to access Amazon S3 bucket, and to use Amazon SageMaker service. An Amazon S3 bucket to store training data. Amazon SageMaker trains data from an Amazon S3 bucket. Following are the steps to load training data from Vantage to an Amazon S3 bucket: Go to Amazon SageMaker console and create a notebook instance. See Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide for instructions on how to create a notebook instance: Open your notebook instance: Start a new file by clicking on New → conda_python3: Install Teradata Python library: !pip install teradataml In a new cell and import additional libraries: import teradataml as tdml from teradataml import create_context, get_context, remove_context from teradataml.dataframe.dataframe import DataFrame import pandas as pd import boto3, os In a new cell, connect to Teradata Vantage. Replace , , to match your Vantage environment: create_context(host = '', username = '', password = '') Retrieve data rom the table where the training dataset resides using TeradataML DataFrame API: train_data = tdml.DataFrame('table_with_training_data') trainDF = train_data.to_pandas() Write data to a local file: trainFileName = 'train.csv' trainDF.to_csv(trainFileName, header=None, index=False) Upload the file to Amazon S3: bucket = 'sagedemo' prefix = 'sagemaker/train' trainFile = open(trainFileName, 'rb') boto3.Session().resource('s3').Bucket(bucket).Object(os.path.join(prefix, localFile)).upload_fileobj(trainFile) Select Training jobs on the left menu under Training, then click on Create training job: At the Create training job window, fill in the Job name (e.g. xgboost-bank) and Create a new role for the IAM role. Choose Any S3 bucket for the Amazon S3 buckets and Create role: Back in the Create training job window, use XGBoost as the algorithm: Use the default ml.m4.xlarge instance type, and 30GB of additional storage volume per instance. This is a short training job, shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. Fill in following hyperparameters and leave everything else as default: num_round=100 silent=0 eta=0.2 gamma=4 max_depth=5 min_child_weight=6 subsample=0.8 objective='binary:logistic' For Input data configuration, enter the Amazon S3 bucket where you stored your training data. Input mode is File. Content type is csv. S3 location is where the file uploaded to: For Output data configuration, enter path where the output data will be stored: Leave everything else as default, and click on “Create training job”. Detail instructions on how to configure the training job can be found in Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide. Once the training job’s created, Amazon SageMaker launches the ML instances to train the model, and stores the resulting model artifacts and other output in the Output data configuration (path//output by default). After you train your model, deploy it using a persistent endpoint Select Models under Inference from the left panel, then Create model. Fill in the model name (e.g. xgboost-bank), and choose the IAM role you created from the previous step. For Container definition 1, use 433757028032.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/xgboost:latest as Location of inference code image. Location of model artifacts is the output path of your training job Leave everything else as default, then Create model. Select the model you just created, then click on Create endpoint configuration: Fill in the name (e.g. xgboost-bank) and use default for everything else. The model name and training job should be automatically populated for you. Click on Create endpoint configuration. Select Inference → Models from the left panel, select the model again, and click on Create endpoint this time: Fill in the name (e.g. xgboost-bank), and select Use an existing endpoint configuration: image::cloud-guides/sagemaker-with-teradata-vantage/attach.endpoint.configuration.png[Attach endpoint configuration] Select the endpoint configuration created from last step, and click on Select endpoint configuration: Leave everything else as default and click on Create endpoint. Now the model is deployed to the endpoint and can be used by client applications. This how-to demonstrated how to extract training data from Vantage and use it to train a model in Amazon SageMaker.

ML Studio can consume data from Azure Blob Storage. This getting started guide will show how you can copy Teradata Vantage data sets to a Blob Storage using ML Studio 'built-in' Jupter Notebook feature. The data can then be used by ML Studio to build and train machine learning models and deploy them into a production environment. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Azure subscription or create free account Azure ML Studio workspace (Optional) Download AdventureWorks DW 2016 database (i.e. 'Training the Model' section) Restore and copy 'vTargetMail' table from SQL Server to Teradata Vantage During ML Studio workspace creation, you may need to create 'new' storage account unless you have one in current availability locations and choose DEVTEST Standard for Web service plan for this getting started guide. Logon to Azure portal, open your storage account and create a container if one does not exist already. Copy your storage account name and key to notepad which we will use for Python3 Notebook to access your Azure Blob Storage account. Finally, open Configuration property and set 'Secure transfer required' to Disabled to allow ML Studio Import Data module to access blob storage account. To get the data to ML Studio, we first need to load data from Teradata Vantage to a Azure Blob Storage. We will create a ML Jupyter Notebook, install Python packages to connect to Teradata and save data to Azure Blob Storage, Logon to Azure portal, go to to your ML Studio workspace and Launch Machine Learning Studio and Sign In. You should see the following screen and click on Notebooks, ensure you are in the right region/ workspace and click on Notebook New Choose Python3 and name your notebook instance In your jupyter notebook instance, install Teradata Vantage Python package for Advanced Analytics: pip install teradataml There is no validation between Microsoft Azure ML Studio and Teradata Vantage Python package. Install Microsoft Azure Storage Blob Client Library for Python: !pip install azure-storage-blob Import the following libraries: import teradataml as tdml from teradataml import create_context, get_context, remove_context from teradataml.dataframe.dataframe import DataFrame import pandas as pd from azure.storage.blob import (BlockBlobService) Connect to Teradata using command: create_context(host = '', username = '', password = '') Retrieve Data using Teradata Python DataFrame module: train_data = DataFrame.from_table(\"\") Convert Teradata DataFrame to Panda DataFrame: trainDF = train_data.to_pandas() Convert data to CSV: trainDF = trainDF.to_csv(head=True,index=False) Assign variables for Azue Blob Storage account name, key and container name: accountName=\"\" accountKey=\"\" containerName=\"mldata\" Upload file to Azure Blob Storage: blobService = BlockBlobService(account_name=accountName, account_key=accountKey) blobService.create_blob_from_text(containerNAme, 'vTargetMail.csv', trainDF) Logon to Azure portal, open blob storage account to view uploaded file: We will use the existing Analyze data with Azure Machine Learning article to build a predictive machine learning model based on data from Azure Blob Storage. We will build a targeted marketing campaign for Adventure Works, the bike shop, by predicting if a customer is likely to buy a bike or not. The data is on Azure Blob Storage file called vTargetMail.csv which we copied in the section above. 1.. Sign into Azure Machine Learning studio and click on Experiments. 2.. Click +NEW on the bottom left of the screen and select Blank Experiment. 3.. Enter a name for your experiment: Targeted Marketing. 4.. Drag Import data module under Data Input and output from the modules pane into the canvas. 5.. Specify the details of your Azure Blob Storage (account name, key and container name) in the Properties pane. Run the experiment by clicking Run under the experiment canvas. After the experiment finishes running successfully, click the output port at the bottom of the Import Data module and select Visualize to see the imported data. To clean the data, drop some columns that are not relevant for the model. To do this: Drag Select Columns in Dataset module under Data Transformation < Manipulation into the canvas. Connect this module to the Import Data module. Click Launch column selector in Properties pane to specify which columns you wish to drop. Exclude two columns: CustomerAlternateKey and GeographyKey. We will split the data 80-20: 80% to train a machine learning model and 20% to test the model. We will make use of the \"Two-Class\" algorithms for this binary classification problem. Drag SplitData module into the canvas and connect with 'Select Columns in DataSet'. In the properties pane, enter 0.8 for Fraction of rows in the first output dataset. Search and drag Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree module into the canvas. Search and drag Train Model module into the canvas and specify inputs by connecting it to the Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree (ML algorithm) and Split Data (data to train the algorithm on) modules. Then, click Launch column selector in the Properties pane. Select the BikeBuyer column as the column to predict. Now, we will test how the model performs on test data. We will compare the algorithm of our choice with a different algorithm to see which performs better. Drag Score Model module into the canvas and connect it to Train Model and Split Data modules. Search and drag Two-Class Bayes Point Machine into the experiment canvas. We will compare how this algorithm performs in comparison to the Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree. Copy and Paste the modules Train Model and Score Model in the canvas. Search and drag Evaluate Model module into the canvas to compare the two algorithms. Run the experiment. Click the output port at the bottom of the Evaluate Model module and click Visualize. The metrics provided are the ROC curve, precision-recall diagram and lift curve. Looking at these metrics, we can see that the first model performed better than the second one. To look at the what the first model predicted, click on output port of the Score Model and click Visualize. You will see two more columns added to your test dataset. 1. Scored Probabilities: the likelihood that a customer is a bike buyer. 2. Scored Labels: the classification done by the model - bike buyer (1) or not (0). This probability threshold for labeling is set to 50% and can be adjusted. Comparing the column BikeBuyer (actual) with the Scored Labels (prediction), you can see how well the model has performed. As next steps, you can use this model to make predictions for new customers and publish this model as a web service or write results back to SQL Data Warehouse. To learn more about building predictive machine learning models, refer to Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure. For large data set copies, consider using the Teradata Access Module for Azure that interfaces between the Teradata Parallel Transporter load/unload operators and Azure Blob Storage.

Vertex AI is Google’s single environment for data scientists to develop and deploy ML models, from experimentation, to deployment, to managing and monitoring models. In this tutorial, we will show how to integrate Vantage Analytics capabilites in Vertex AI ML Pipelines. We’ll create two pipelines: Training - the first will be a three step pipeline to train and deploy a model; the first step transforms data in Vantage and then exports a file for training, the second step trains a model using scikit-learn, and the final step deploys the model to Vantage using Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature of Teradata Vantage. Scoring - the second pipeline will use the model created by the the first pipeline to score new data stored in a table on Vantage. Both pipelines are very simple, but the first pipeline could be triggered to retrain a model with new data when the production model has drifted. The second pipeline could be run on a regular schedule when new data for scoring was available. Google Cloud account - register here Kaggle account - register here Setup the notebook environment import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ipython-sql !{sys.executable} -m pip install teradatasqlalchemy teradataml kaggle ipython-sql kfp Setup a Vantage instance Follow the Run Vantage Express on Google Cloud how-to to get Vantage setup. Make sure to follow the instructions to open the VM up to the Internet. Create GCS bucket You will need a GCS bucket to store artifacts managed by KubeFlow. Define the bucket name: BUCKET_NAME = \"\" If the bucket doesn’t exist, go ahead and create it: !gsutil ls -b gs://$BUCKET_NAME || gsutil mb gs://$BUCKET_NAME Give permissions to Vertex AI to access your bucket Go to IAM tab in GCS console and assign Storage Admin role to your default Compute Engine. The principal of the default Compute Engine account looks like this: -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com. Download sample data We’ll use the Boston Housing dataset which can be obtained from Kaggle. Login to your Kaggle account. In the top right corner click on your user icon and select Account. Find API section and click on Create New API Token. This will produce kaggle.json file. Open kaggle.json and copy the username and key. Substitute the values in the cell and run it: %env KAGGLE_USERNAME= %env KAGGLE_KEY= !kaggle datasets download -f housing.csv vikrishnan/boston-house-prices Load training data to Vantage Let’s setup DATABASE_URL environment variable that will point to your instance of Vantage. Make sure that you default to mldb database where BYOM package is installed, e.g.: DATABASE_URL='teradatasql://dbc:dbc@34.121.78.209/mldb' %env DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL import pandas import os df=pandas.read_fwf('housing.csv', names=['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV']) df.to_sql('housing', con=DATABASE_URL, index=False) For this tutiorial we need a table to store the trained model and another table with some new data that we want to score with our model. Use teradatasql to execute the following SQL on your Vantage instance. %%sql CREATE SET TABLE demo_models (model_id VARCHAR (30), model BLOB) PRIMARY INDEX (model_id); CREATE SET TABLE test_housing (ID INTEGER, CRIM FLOAT, ZN FLOAT,INDUS FLOAT,CHAS INTEGER,NOX FLOAT,RM FLOAT, AGE FLOAT,DIS FLOAT, RAD INTEGER,TAX INTEGER,PTRATIO FLOAT,B FLOAT,LSTAT FLOAT) PRIMARY INDEX (CRIM); INSERT INTO test_housing (ID, CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT) VALUES (1,.02,0.0,7.07,0,.46,6.4,78.9,4.9,2,242,17.8,396.9,9.14); Now we are ready to create the components in the pipeline. Vertex AI Pipelines can run pipelines built using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK or TensorFlow Extended. We’ll be using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK for this simple example using scikit-learn. In this example we will create the following three components: read_data_from_vantage input: ipaddr of the VM hosting Vantage output: csv file with the data for training and testing train_model input: csv file with data for training and testing output: file containing the model output: Metric artifact with model performance deploy_model input: file containing the model First, import the Kubeflow Pipeline component and dsl packages. import kfp.v2.dsl as dsl from kfp.v2.dsl import ( component, Input, Output, Dataset, Model, Metrics, ) The first component reads data from a Vantage warehouse (see above and make sure you have set up Vantage Express in Google Cloud including opening up a firewall to the VM so you can access Vantage from the Internet.) The component connects to Vantage using the connection string passed as an input parameter, reads the rows from the table mldb.housing in Vantage and then outputs the data to an Output[Dataset]. The Output is a temporary file used to pass data between components (see more about passing data between components here). The component uses sqlalchemy to talk to Teradata. Each component is run in a separate container on Kubernetes so all import statements need to be done within the component. We have created a base image with teradatasql already installed. When you pass base_image='python' the component will use that image to create a container. packages_to_install parameter defines what other packages the component needs. @component(base_image='python', packages_to_install=['teradatasqlalchemy']) def read_data_from_vantage( connection_string: str, output_file: Output[Dataset] ): import sqlalchemy file_name = output_file.path engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) with engine.connect() as con: rs = con.execute('SELECT * FROM housing') with open(output_file.path, 'w') as output_file: output_file.write('CRIM,ZN,INDUS,CHAS,NOX,RM,AGE,DIS,RAD,TAX,PTRATIO,B,LSTAT,MEDV\\n') for row in rs: output_file.write(','.join([str(i) for i in row]) + '\\n') Next we’ll create a component to train a model with the training data. The input into this component is the file from the previous component. The output is the file with the trained model using joblib.dump and a file with the test data. The component will use scikit-learn and pandas so we need to pass packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn'] - this will tell Kubeflow to install the packages when the container is created. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml', packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn','sklearn-pandas==1.5.0']) def train_model( input_file : Input[Dataset], output_model: Output[Model], output_metrics: Output[Metrics] ): import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn import metrics from sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper import joblib from sklearn2pmml.pipeline import PMMLPipeline from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml df = pd.read_csv(input_file.path) train, test = train_test_split(df, test_size = .33) train = train.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore') test = test.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore') target = 'MEDV' features = train.columns.drop(target) pipeline = PMMLPipeline([ (\"mapping\", DataFrameMapper([ (['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT'], StandardScaler()) ])), (\"rfc\", RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 100, random_state = 0)) ]) pipeline.fit(train[features], train[target]) y_pred = pipeline.predict(test[features]) metric_accuracy = metrics.mean_squared_error(y_pred,test[target]) output_metrics.log_metric('accuracy', metric_accuracy) output_model.metadata['accuracy'] = metric_accuracy joblib.dump(pipeline, output_model.path) The last component loads the model and tests it on the test data. The Output[Metrics] creates an artifact with the models performance and can be visualize in the Runtime Graph. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml') def deploy_model( connection_string: str, input_model : Input[Model], ): import sqlalchemy import teradataml as tdml import joblib from sklearn2pmml.pipeline import PMMLPipeline from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) tdml.create_context(tdsqlengine = engine) pipeline = joblib.load(input_model.path) sklearn2pmml(pipeline, \"test_local.pmml\", with_repr = True) model_id = 'housing_rf' model_file = 'test_local.pmml' table_name = 'demo_models' tdml.configure.byom_install_location = \"mldb\" try: res = tdml.save_byom(model_id = model_id, model_file = model_file, table_name = table_name) except Exception as e: # if our model exists, delete and rewrite if str(e.args).find('TDML_2200') >= 1: res = tdml.delete_byom(model_id = model_id, table_name = table_name) res = tdml.save_byom(model_id = model_id, model_file = model_file, table_name = table_name) pass else: raise Now we’ll create a function to execute each component in the pipeline. @dsl.pipeline( name='run-vantage-pipeline', description='An example pipeline that connects to Vantage.', ) def run_vantage_pipeline_vertex( connection_string: str ): data_file = read_data_from_vantage(connection_string).output test_model_data = train_model(data_file) deploy_model(connection_string,test_model_data.outputs['output_model']) Compile the pipeline. The pipline will be saved in a json file with the name provided as the package_path. from kfp.v2 import compiler compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=run_vantage_pipeline_vertex, package_path='train_housing_pipeline.json') Now use the Vertex AI client to execute the pipeline. Import the google.cloud.aiplatform package. Vertex AI needs a Cloud Storage bucket to for temporary files. Create a new job using the json file above and pass the ipaddr as the parameter. Then submit the job. When the job starts a link will appear that will take you to the Runtime Graph. import google.cloud.aiplatform as aip pipeline_root_path = 'gs://' + BUCKET_NAME job = aip.PipelineJob( display_name=\"housing_training_deploy\", template_path=\"train_housing_pipeline.json\", pipeline_root=pipeline_root_path, parameter_values={ 'connection_string': DATABASE_URL } ) job.submit() When the pipeline has completed running (each component in the graph should have a green check mark). You can click on each component to see details of the execution and the logs created. If you click on the output_metrics artifact, in the Pipeline run analysis window the Node Info will show the accuracy of the model. Yyou can learn more about other metrics you can pass and visulation using the Metrics artifict here.) Let’s test the model we have just deployed by scoring some new data. We’ll use the teradataml driver to retrieve the saved model and score the rows in a table with new data. import teradataml as tdml import sqlalchemy import os engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL) eng = tdml.create_context(tdsqlengine = engine) #indicate the database that BYOM is using tdml.configure.byom_install_location = \"mldb\" tdf_test = tdml.DataFrame('test_housing') modeldata = tdml.retrieve_byom(\"housing_rf\", table_name=\"demo_models\") predictions = tdml.PMMLPredict( modeldata = modeldata, newdata = tdf_test, accumulate = ['ID'] ) predictions.result.to_pandas() This pipeline will have only one component that uses the teradatasql driver to execute a SQL query that retrieves the model from the demo_model table and scores the rows in the test_housing table. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml', packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn']) def score_new_data( connection_string: str, model_name: str, model_table: str, data_table: str, prediction_table: str ): import teradataml as tdml import sqlalchemy engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) with engine.connect() as con: con.execute(f'CREATE TABLE {prediction_table} AS (SELECT * FROM mldb.PMMLPredict ( ON {data_table} ON (SELECT * FROM {model_table} where model_id=\\'{model_name}\\') DIMENSION USING Accumulate (\\'ID\\')) AS td ) WITH DATA') The run_new_data_score pipeline takes the following parameters: model_name: ID of the model model_table: the name of the table storing the model data_table: the name of the table with new data to score prediction_table: the name of the table to store the scoring results When the pipeline is executed the dashboard will provide fields to enter the values you want to use. @dsl.pipeline( name='new-data-pipeline', description='An example of a component that scores new data with a saved model.', ) def run_new_data_score( connection_string: str, model_name: str, model_table: str, data_table: str, prediction_table: str ): score_new_data(DATABASE_URL,model_name,model_table,data_table,prediction_table) To compile the pipeline run the following code. The pipeline will be saved in score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json file. compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=run_new_data_score, package_path='score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json') We will now execute the pipeline in Vertex AI Pipelines. import google.cloud.aiplatform as aip pipeline_root_path = 'gs://' + BUCKET_NAME job = aip.PipelineJob( display_name=\"new_data_housing\", template_path=\"score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json\", pipeline_root=pipeline_root_path, parameter_values={ 'connection_string': DATABASE_URL, 'model_name': 'housing_rf', 'model_table': 'demo_models', 'data_table': 'test_housing', 'prediction_table': 'housing_predictions' } ) job.submit() Once the job completes, you can view the batch predictions with: %%sql SELECT * FROM housing_predictions; To stop incurring charges you need to clean up the following resources: Delete the Vantage Express VM - go to the list of Compute Engine instances and selecting the instance with Vantage Express and then click on Delete.

You need access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. This how-to assumes you know Feast terminology. If you need a refresher check out the official FEAST documentation This document demonstrates how developers can integrate Teradata’s offline and online store with Feast. Teradata’s offline stores allow users to use any underlying data store as their offline feature store. Features can be retrieved from the offline store for model training and can be materialized into the online feature store for use during model inference. On the other hand, online stores are used to serve features at low latency. The materialize command can be used to load feature values from the data sources (or offline stores) into the online store The feast-teradata library adds support for Teradata as OfflineStore OnlineStore Additionally, using Teradata as the registry (catalog) is already supported via the registry_type: sql and included in our examples. This means that everything is located in Teradata. However, depending on the requirements, installation, etc, this can be mixed and matched with other systems as appropriate. To get started, install the feast-teradata library pip install feast-teradata Let’s create a simple feast setup with Teradata using the standard drivers' dataset. Note that you cannot use feast init as this command only works for templates that are part of the core feast library. We intend on getting this library merged into feast core eventually but for now, you will need to use the following cli command for this specific task. All other feast cli commands work as expected. feast-td init-repo This will then prompt you for the required information for the Teradata system and upload the example dataset. Let’s assume you used the repo name demo when running the above command. You can find the repository files along with a file called test_workflow.py. Running this test_workflow.py will execute a complete workflow for the feast with Teradata as the Registry, OfflineStore, and OnlineStore. demo/ feature_repo/ driver_repo.py feature_store.yml test_workflow.py From within the demo/feature_repo directory, execute the following feast command to apply (import/update) the repo definition into the registry. You will be able to see the registry metadata tables in the teradata database after running this command. feast apply To see the registry information in the feast UI, run the following command. Note the --registry_ttl_sec is important as by default it polls every 5 seconds. feast ui --registry_ttl_sec=120 project: registry: provider: local offline_store: type: feast_teradata.offline.teradata.TeradataOfflineStore host: database: user: password: log_mech: Below is an example of definition.py which elaborates how to set the entity, source connector, and feature view. Now to explain the different components: TeradataSource: Data Source for features stored in Teradata (Enterprise or Lake) or accessible via a Foreign Table from Teradata (NOS, QueryGrid) Entity: A collection of semantically related features Feature View: A feature view is a group of feature data from a specific data source. Feature views allow you to consistently define features and their data sources, enabling the reuse of feature groups across a project driver = Entity(name=\"driver\", join_keys=[\"driver_id\"]) project_name = yaml.safe_load(open(\"feature_store.yaml\"))[\"project\"] driver_stats_source = TeradataSource( database=yaml.safe_load(open(\"feature_store.yaml\"))[\"offline_store\"][\"database\"], table=f\"{project_name}_feast_driver_hourly_stats\", timestamp_field=\"event_timestamp\", created_timestamp_column=\"created\", ) driver_stats_fv = FeatureView( name=\"driver_hourly_stats\", entities=[driver], ttl=timedelta(weeks=52 * 10), schema=[ Field(name=\"driver_id\", dtype=Int64), Field(name=\"conv_rate\", dtype=Float32), Field(name=\"acc_rate\", dtype=Float32), Field(name=\"avg_daily_trips\", dtype=Int64), ], source=driver_stats_source, tags={\"team\": \"driver_performance\"}, ) There are two different ways to test your offline store as explained below. But first, there are a few mandatory steps to follow: Now, let’s batch-read some features for training, using only entities (population) for which we have seen an event in the last 60 days. The predicates (filter) used can be on anything relevant for the entity (population) selection for the given training dataset. The event_timestamp is only for example purposes. from feast import FeatureStore store = FeatureStore(repo_path=\"feature_repo\") training_df = store.get_historical_features( entity_df=f\"\"\" SELECT driver_id, event_timestamp FROM demo_feast_driver_hourly_stats WHERE event_timestamp BETWEEN (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '60' DAY) AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP \"\"\", features=[ \"driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate\", \"driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate\", \"driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips\" ], ).to_df() print(training_df.head()) The feast-teradata library allows you to use the complete set of feast APIs and functionality. Please refer to the official feast quickstart for more details on the various things you can do. Feast materializes data to online stores for low-latency lookup at model inference time. Typically, key-value stores are used for online stores, however, relational databases can be used for this purpose as well. Users can develop their own online stores by creating a class that implements the contract in the OnlineStore class. project: registry: provider: local offline_store: type: feast_teradata.offline.teradata.TeradataOfflineStore host: database: user: password: log_mech: There are a few mandatory steps to follow before we can test the online store: The command materialize_incremental is used to incrementally materialize features in the online store. If there are no new features to be added, this command will essentially not be doing anything. With feast materialize_incremental, the start time is either now — ttl (the ttl that we defined in our feature views) or the time of the most recent materialization. If you’ve materialized features at least once, then subsequent materializations will only fetch features that weren’t present in the store at the time of the previous materializations. CURRENT_TIME=$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S') feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME Next, while fetching the online features, we have two parameters features and entity_rows. The features parameter is a list and can take any number of features that are present in the df_feature_view. The example above shows all 4 features present but these can be less than 4 as well. Secondly, the entity_rows parameter is also a list and takes a dictionary of the form {feature_identifier_column: value_to_be_fetched}. In our case, the column driver_id is used to uniquely identify the different rows of the entity driver. We are currently fetching values of the features where driver_id is equal to 5. We can also fetch multiple such rows using the format: [{driver_id: val_1}, {driver_id: val_2}, .., {driver_id: val_n}] [{driver_id: val_1}, {driver_id: val_2}, .., {driver_id: val_n}] entity_rows = [ { \"driver_id\": 1001, }, { \"driver_id\": 1002, }, ] features_to_fetch = [ \"driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate\", \"driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate\", \"driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips\" ] returned_features = store.get_online_features( features=features_to_fetch, entity_rows=entity_rows, ).to_dict() for key, value in sorted(returned_features.items()): print(key, \" : \", value) Another important thing is the SQL Registry. We first make a path variable that uses the username, password, database name, etc. to make a connection string which it then uses to establish a connection to Teradata’s Database. path = 'teradatasql://'+ teradata_user +':' + teradata_password + '@'+host + '/?database=' + teradata_database + '&LOGMECH=' + teradata_log_mech It will create the following table in your database: Entities (entity_name,project_id,last_updated_timestamp,entity_proto) Data_sources (data_source_name,project_id,last_updated_timestamp,data_source_proto) Feature_views (feature_view_name,project_id,last_updated_timestamp,materialized_intervals,feature_view_proto,user_metadata) Request_feature_views (feature_view_name,project_id,last_updated_timestamp,feature_view_proto,user_metadata) Stream_feature_views (feature_view_name,project_id,last_updated_timestamp,feature_view_proto,user_metadata) managed_infra (infra_name, project_id, last_updated_timestamp, infra_proto) validation_references (validation_reference_name, project_id, last_updated_timestamp, validation_reference_proto) saved_datasets (saved_dataset_name, project_id, last_updated_timestamp, saved_dataset_proto) feature_services (feature_service_name, project_id, last_updated_timestamp, feature_service_proto) on_demand_feature_views (feature_view_name, project_id, last_updated_timestamp, feature_view_proto, user_metadata) Additionally, if you want to see a complete (but not real-world), end-to-end example workflow example, see the demo/test_workflow.py script. This is used for testing the complete feast functionality. An Enterprise Feature Store accelerates the value-gaining process in crucial stages of data analysis. It enhances productivity and reduces the time taken to introduce products in the market. By integrating Teradata with Feast, it enables the use of Teradata’s highly efficient parallel processing within a Feature Store, thereby enhancing performance.

Type Array of Object Default Configuration When working with pooling profiles and the Select operation, the connection remains open until one of the following occurs: The flow execution ends The content of the streams are consumed completely The connection is the transaction key. Because LOBs are treated as streams, the connection remains open until the flow execution ends, or until the content is consumed before the flow completes, in which case the best approach is taken to close the related connection. This behavior occurs because the result set the operation generates can have a stream or be part of an ongoing transaction. DB:BAD_SQL_SYNTAX DB:CONNECTIVITY DB:QUERY_EXECUTION This operation selects a single data record from a database. If you provide an SQL query that returns more than one row, then only the first record is processed and returned. This operation does not use streaming, which means that immediately after performing the Query Single operation, the complete content of the selected record is loaded into memory.

DB:BAD_SQL_SYNTAX DB:CONNECTIVITY DB:QUERY_EXECUTION Invokes a stored procedure on the database. When the stored procedure returns one or more ResultSet instances, results are not read all at once. Instead, results are automatically streamed to prevent performance and memory issues. This behavior means that pages of fetchSize rows are loaded lazily when needed. If the Stored procedure operation is performed inside a transaction (for example, in a Try scope component), and that transaction is closed before consuming the data, accessing the results that haven’t been loaded will fail.

Optionally, you can provide watermark and ID columns. If a watermark column is provided, the values taken from that column are used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are returned. If an ID column is provided, this component automatically verifies that the same row is not picked twice by concurrent polls. This operation does not support streaming, meaning that there is no need to perform additional transformations to the payload in order to access the operation results. This behavior is identical to the Query Single operation released in version 1.9. Name Type Description Default Value Required Configuration String The name of the configuration to use x Table String The name of the table to select from x Watermark Column String The name of the column to use for a watermark.

Setting this to zero disables statement caching. 5 Max Wait Number The amount of time a client trying to obtain a connection waits for it to be acquired when the pool is exhausted. Setting this value to zero (default) means wait indefinitely. This is equivalent to checkoutTimeout and cannot be overridden in additional-properties. 0 Max Wait Unit Enumeration, one of: NANOSECONDS MICROSECONDS MILLISECONDS SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS A #maxWait. SECONDS Max Idle Time Number Determines how many seconds a connection can remain pooled but unused before being discarded. Setting this value to zero (default) means idle connections never expire. 0 Additional Properties Object A map in which keys are the name of a pooling profile configuration property. Does not support the use of expressions. These properties cannot be used to override any of the previously specified properties (like Max Pool Size or Min Pool Size), the main property prevails if an attempt is made to override it. The map’s values contain the actual assignation for each parameter. Max Statement Number Defines the total number PreparedStatements a DataSource will cache. The pool destroys the least-recently-used PreparedStatement when it reaches the specified limit. When set to 0, statement caching is turned off Test connection on checkout Boolean Disables connection testing on checkout to improve performance. If set to true, an operation is performed at every connection checkout to verify that the connection is valid.

Airflow is a task scheduling tool that is typically used to build data pipelines to process and load data. In this example, we go through the Airflow installation process, which creates a Docker-based Airflow environment. Once Airflow is installed, we run several Airflow DAG (Direct Acyclic Graph, or simply workflow) examples that load data into a Teradata Vantage database. Access to AWS (Amazon Web Services) with permissions to create a VM. This tutorial can be adjusted to other compute platforms or even on a bare metal machine as long as it has a computing and storage capacity comparable to the machine mentioned in this document (t2.2xlarge EC2 on AWS with approximately 100GB of storage) and is connected to the internet. If you decide to use a different compute platform, some steps in the tutorial will have to be altered. An SSH client. If you are on a Mac or a Linux machine, these tools are already included. If you are on Windows, consider PuTTY or MobaXterm. Access to a Teradata Vantage database. If you don’t have access to Teradata Vantage, explore Vantage Express - a free edition for developers. Go to the AWS EC2 console and click on Launch instance. Select Red Hat for OS image. Select t2.2xlarge for instance type. Create a new key pair or use an existing one. Apply network settings that will allow you ssh to the server and the server will have outbound connectivity to the Internet. Usually, applying the default settings will do. Assign 100GB of storage. ssh to the machine using ec2-user user. Check if python is installed (should be Python 3.7 or higher). Type python or python3 on the command line. If python is not installed (you are getting command not found message) run the commands below to install it. The commands may require you to confirm the installation by typing y and enter. sudo yum install python3 # create a virtual environment for the project sudo yum install python3-pip sudo pip3 install virtualenv Create the Airflow directory structure (from the ec2-user home directory /home/ec2-user) mkdir airflow cd airflow mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins ./data ./config ./data echo -e \"AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\" > .env Use your preferred file transfer tool (scp, PuTTY, MobaXterm, or similar) to upload airflow.cfg file to airflow/config directory. Docker is a containerization tool that allows us to install Airflow in a containerized environment. The steps must be executed in airflow directory. Uninstall podman (RHEL containerization tool) sudo yum remove docker \\ docker-client \\ docker-client-latest \\ docker-common \\ docker-latest \\ docker-latest-logrotate \\ docker-logrotate \\ docker-engine \\ podman \\ runc Install yum utilities sudo yum install -y yum-utils Add docker to yum repository. sudo yum-config-manager \\ --add-repo \\ https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo Install docker. sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Start docker as a service. The first command runs the docker service automatically when the system starts up next time. The second command starts Docker now. sudo systemctl enable docker sudo systemctl start docker Check if Docker is installed correctly. This command should return an empty list of containers (since we have not started any container yet): sudo docker ps Upload docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile files to the VM and save them in airflow directory. What docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile do docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile files are necessary to build the environment during the installation. The docker-compose.yaml file downloads and installs the Airflow docker container. The container includes the web ui, a Postgres database for metadata, the scheduler, 3 workers (so 3 tasks can be run in parallel), the trigger and the nginx web server to show the docs produced by dbt. In addition host directories are mounted on containers and various other install processes are performed. Dockerfile will additionally install needed packages in each container. If you would like to learn more what docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile files do, examine these files. There are comments which clarify what is installed and why. Install docker-compose (necessary to run the yaml file). The instructions are based on version 1.29.2. Check out https://github.com/docker/compose/releases site for the latest release and update the command below as needed. sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose Test your docker-compose installation. The command should return the docker-compose version, for example docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c: docker-compose --version These steps set up a sample dbt project. dbt tool itself will be installed on the containers later by docker-compose. Install git: sudo yum install git Get the sample jaffle shop dbt project: The dbt directories will be created under the home directory (not under airflow). The home directory in our example is /home/ec2-user. # move to home dir cd mkdir dbt cd dbt git clone https://github.com/Teradata/jaffle_shop-dev.git jaffle_shop cd jaffle_shop mkdir target chmod 777 target echo '' > target/index.html chmod o+w target/index.html Create the airflowtest and jaffle_shop users/databases on your Teradata database by using your preferred database tool (Teradata Studio Express, bteq or similar). Log into the database as dbc, then execute the commands (change the passwords if needed): CREATE USER \"airflowtest\" FROM \"dbc\" AS PERM=5000000000 PASSWORD=\"abcd\"; CREATE USER \"jaffle_shop\" FROM \"dbc\" AS PERM=5000000000 PASSWORD=\"abcd\"; Create the dbt configuration directory: cd mkdir .dbt Copy profiles.yml into the .dbt directory. Edit the file so it corresponds to your Teradata database setup. At a minium, you will need to change the host, user and password. Use jaffle_shop user credentials you set up in step 3. Run the docker environment creation script in the airflow directory where Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml: cd ~/airflow sudo docker-compose up --build This can take 5-10 minutes, when the installation is complete you should see on the screen a message similar to this: airflow-webserver_1 | 127.0.0.1 - - [13/Sep/2022:00:20:48 +0000] \"GET /health HTTP/1.1\" 200 187 \"-\" \"curl/7.74.0\" This means the Airflow webserver is ready to accept calls. Now Airflow should be up. The terminal session that we were using during the installation will be used to display log messages, so it is recommended to open another terminal session for subsequent steps. To check the Airflow installation type: sudo docker ps The result should be something like: CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 60d50d9f43f5 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 8080/tcp airflow_airflow-scheduler_1 e2b46ec98274 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 8080/tcp airflow_airflow-worker_3_1 7b44004c7277 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 8080/tcp airflow_airflow-worker_1_1 4017b8ce9235 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp airflow_airflow-webserver_1 3cc407e2d565 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 0.0.0.0:5555->5555/tcp, :::5555->5555/tcp, 8080/tcp airflow_flower_1 340a83b202e3 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 8080/tcp airflow_airflow-triggerer_1 82198f0d8b84 apache/airflow:2.2.4 \"/usr/bin/dumb-init …\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 8080/tcp airflow_airflow-worker_2_1 382c3077c1e5 redis:latest \"docker-entrypoint.s…\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 6379/tcp airflow_redis_1 8a3be8d8a7f4 nginx \"/docker-entrypoint.…\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 0.0.0.0:4000->80/tcp, :::4000->80/tcp airflow_nginx_1 9ca888e9e8df postgres:13 \"docker-entrypoint.s…\" 18 minutes ago Up 18 minutes (healthy) 5432/tcp airflow_postgres_1 OPTIONAL: If you want to delete the docker installation (for example to update the docker-compose.yaml and the Dockerfile files and recreate a different environment), the command is (from the airflow directory where these files are located): sudo docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all Once the stack is down, update the configuration files and restart by running the command in step 1. To test if the Airflow web UI works, type the following urls on your browser. Replace with the external IP address of the VM: DAG UI: http://:8080/home - username: airflow / password: airflow Flower Airflow UI (worker control): http://:5555/ Copy airflow_dbt_integration.py, db_test_example_dag.py, discover_dag.txt, variables.json files to /home/ec2-user/airflow/dags. Examine the files: airflow_dbt_integration.py - a simple Teradata sql example that creates a few tables and runs queries. db_test_example_dag.py - runs a dbt example (i.e. integration of dbt and airflow with a Teradata database). In this example a fictitious jaffle_shop data model is created, loaded and the documentation for this project is produced (you can view it by pointing your browser to http://:4000/) Adjust db_test_example_dag.py db_test_example_dag.py needs to be updated so that the Teradata database IP address points to your database. discover_dag.py - an example on how to load various types of data files (CSV, Parquet, JSON). The source code file contains comments that explain what the program does and how to use it. This example relies on variables.json file. The file needs to be imported into Airflow. It will happen in subsequent steps. Wait for a few minutes until these dag files are picked up by the airflow tool. Once they are picked up they will appear on the list of dags on the Airflow home page. Import variables.json file as a variable file into Airflow: Click on Admin → Variables menu item to go to the Variables page Click on Choose File, then select variable.json in your file explorer and click on Import Variables Edit the variables to match your environment Run the dags from the UI and check the logs. This tutorial aimed at providing a hands on exercise on how to install an Airflow environment on a Linux server and how to use Airflow to interact with a Teradata Vantage database. An additional example is provided on how to integrate Airflow and the data modelling and maintenance tool dbt to create and load a Teradata Vantage database.

Use Query Service if you are looking to query and access the Analytics Database through a REST API. This how-to provides examples of common use cases to help you get started with Query Service API. Before starting, make sure you have: Access to a VantageCloud system where Query Service is provisioned, or a VantageCore with Query Service enabled connectivity. If you are an admin and need to install Query Service, see Query Service Installation, Configuration, and Usage Guide. Query Service hostname and system name Authorization credentials to connect to the database Having trouble with the prerequisites? Contact Teradata for setup information. When using the examples, please keep in mind that: The examples in this document use Python, and you can use these to create examples in your language of choice. The examples provided here are complete and ready for you to use, although most require a little customization. The examples in this document use the URL https://:1443/. Replace the following variables with your own value: : Server where Query Service is installed : Preconfigured alias of the system Provide valid credentials to access the target Analytics Database using HTTP Basic or JWT authentication. The database username and password are combined into a string (\"username : password\") which is then encoded using Base64. The API response contains the authorization method and encoded credentials.

Interface: An environment to write and run data projects, connect to the Teradata system, and visualize data. You can use either JupyterLab or Workspaces CLI. Query Engine: A fully managed computational resource that you can use to run your data science and analytical workloads. This document outlines the steps for installing and configuring Regulus using Docker. To use Regulus with Workspaces CLI, see Use Regulus With Workspaces CLI. Make sure you have the following: GitHub account: If you don’t already have a GitHub account, create one at https://github.com/. AWS account: If you don’t have an AWS account, sign up for an AWS Free Tier account at https://aws.amazon.com/free/. For the developer preview, you can host the query engine only on AWS. Docker: To download and install Docker, See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/. The Workspaces Docker images are monolithic images of Workspaces running the necessary services in a single container. Pull the docker image from Docker Hub. docker pull teradata/regulus-workspaces Before proceeding, make sure to: Copy and retain the environment variables, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, from your AWS Console. See Environment Variables. Set the environment variable, WORKSPACES_HOME, to the directory where the configuration and data files are located. Make sure that the directory exists and appropriate permission is granted. Local Location Container Location Usage $WORKSPACES_HOME /etc/td Stores data and configuration $WORKSPACES_HOME/tls /etc/td/tls Stores cert files You can install Workspaces using one of the following methods: Docker Engine Docker Compose Run the Docker image once you’ve set the WORKSPACES_HOME variable. Modify the directories based on your requirements. docker run -detach \\ --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\"${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\" \\ --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\"${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\" \\ --env AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=\"${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\" \\ --publish 3000:3000 \\ --publish 3282:3282 \\ --volume ${WORKSPACES_HOME}:/etc/td \\ teradata/regulus-workspaces:latest The command downloads and starts a Workspaces container and publishes the ports needed to access it. Once the Workspaces server is initialized and started, you can access Workspaces using the URL: http://:3000/. With Docker Compose, you can easily configure, install, and upgrade your Docker-based Workspaces installation. Install Docker Compose. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/. Create a docker-compose.yml file. version: \"3.9\" services: workspaces: deploy: replicas: 1 container_name: workspaces image: ${WORKSPACES_IMAGE_NAME:-teradata/regulus-workspaces}:${WORKSPACES_IMAGE_TAG:-latest} command: serve -v restart: unless-stopped ports: - \"443:443/tcp\" - \"3000:3000/tcp\" - \"3282:3282/tcp\" environment: TZ: ${WS_TZ:-UTC} AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: \"${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\" AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: \"${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\" AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: \"${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\" volumes: - ${WORKSPACES_HOME:-./volumes/workspaces}:/etc/td - ${WORKSPACES_AWS_CONFIG:-~/.aws}:/root/.aws Go to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located and start Workspaces. Docker compose up -d Once the Workspaces server is initialized and started, you can access Workspaces using the URL: http://:3000/. Workspaces uses the GitHub OAuth App to authorize users and manage the project state. To authorize Workspaces to save your project instance configuration, use the Client ID and Client secret key generated during the GitHub OAuth App registration. The project instance configuration values are maintained in your GitHub repositories. First-time users must perform the following steps before proceeding: Log on to your GitHub account and create an OAuth App. See GitHub Documentation. While registering the OAuth App, type the following Workspaces URLs in the URL fields: Homepage URL: http://:3000/ Authorization callback URL: http://:3000/auth/github/callback Copy and retain the Client ID and Client secret key. To set up Workspaces, do the following: Access Workspaces using the URL: http://:3000/. Apply the following general service configuration under Setup. Setting Description Required?

Teradata offers Teradata Parallel Transporter (TPT) utility that can efficiently load large amounts of data into Teradata Vantage. This how-to demonstrates how to use TPT. In this scenario, we will load over 300k records, over 40MB of data, in a couple of seconds. Access to a Teradata Vantage instance. If you need a test instance of Vantage, you can provision one for free at https://clearscape.teradata.com. Download Teradata Tools and Utilities (TTU) - supported platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (requires registration). Windows MacOS Linux Unzip the downloaded file and run setup.exe. Unzip the downloaded file and run TeradataToolsAndUtilitiesXX.XX.XX.pkg. Unzip the downloaded file, go to the unzipped directory and run: ./setup.sh a We will be working with the US tax fillings for nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit tax filings are public data. The US Internal Revenue Service publishes them in S3 bucket. Let’s grab a summary of filings for 2020: https://downloads.teradata.com/sites/default/files/2022-11/index_2020.csv. You can use your browser, wget or curl to save the file locally. Let’s create a database in Vantage. Use your favorite SQL tool to run the following query: CREATE DATABASE irs AS PERMANENT = 120e6, -- 120MB SPOOL = 120e6; -- 120MB We will now run TPT. TPT is a command-line tool that can be used to load, extract and update data in Teradata Vantage. These various functions are implemented in so called operators. For example, loading data into Vantage is handled by the Load operator. The Load operator is very efficient in uploading large amounts of data into Vantage. The Load operator, in order to be fast, has several restrictions in place. It can only populate empty tables. Inserts to already populated tables are not supported. It doesn’t support tables with secondary indices. Also, it won’t insert duplicate records, even if a table is a MULTISET table. For the full list of restrictions check out Teradata® TPT Reference - Load Operator - Restrictions and Limitations. TPT has its own scripting language. The language allows you to prepare the database with arbitrary SQL commands, declare the input source and define how the data should be inserted into Vantage. To load the csv data to Vantage, we will define and run a job. The job will prepare the database. It will remove old log and error tables and create the target table. It will then read the file and insert the data into the database. Create a job variable file that will tell TPT how to connect to our Vantage database. Create file jobvars.txt and insert the following content. Replace host with the host name of your database. For example, if you are using a local Vantage Express instance, use 127.0.0.1. username with the database user name, and password with the database password. Note that the preparation step (DDL) and the load step have their own configuration values and that the config values need to be entered twice to configure both the DDL and the load step.

That means, that we can use Native Object Storage (NOS) to ingest the data: -- create an S3-backed foreign table CREATE FOREIGN TABLE irs_returns_nos USING ( LOCATION('/s3/s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/index_2020.csv') ); -- load the data into a native table CREATE MULTISET TABLE irs_returns_nos_native (RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME) AS ( SELECT RETURN_ID, FILING_TYPE, EIN, TAX_PERIOD, SUB_DATE, TAXPAYER_NAME FROM irs_returns_nos ) WITH DATA NO PRIMARY INDEX; The NOS solution is convenient as it doesn’t depend on additional tools. It can be implemented using only SQL. It performs well, especially for Vantage deployments with a high number of AMPs as NOS tasks are delegated to AMPs and run in parallel. Also, splitting the data in object storage into multiple files may further improve performance. This how-to demonstrated how to ingest large amounts of data into Vantage. We loaded hundreds of thousands or records into Vantage in a couple of seconds using TPT.

Vertex AI is Google’s single environment for data scientists to develop and deploy ML models, from experimentation, to deployment, to managing and monitoring models. In this tutorial, we will show how to integrate Vantage Analytics capabilites in Vertex AI ML Pipelines. We’ll create two pipelines: Training - the first will be a three step pipeline to train and deploy a model; the first step transforms data in Vantage and then exports a file for training, the second step trains a model using scikit-learn, and the final step deploys the model to Vantage using Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature of Teradata Vantage. Scoring - the second pipeline will use the model created by the the first pipeline to score new data stored in a table on Vantage. Both pipelines are very simple, but the first pipeline could be triggered to retrain a model with new data when the production model has drifted. The second pipeline could be run on a regular schedule when new data for scoring was available. Google Cloud account - register here Kaggle account - register here Setup the notebook environment import sys !{sys.executable} -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ipython-sql !{sys.executable} -m pip install teradatasqlalchemy teradataml kaggle ipython-sql kfp Setup a Vantage instance Follow the Run Vantage Express on Google Cloud how-to to get Vantage setup. Make sure to follow the instructions to open the VM up to the Internet. Create GCS bucket You will need a GCS bucket to store artifacts managed by KubeFlow. Define the bucket name: BUCKET_NAME = \"\" If the bucket doesn’t exist, go ahead and create it: !gsutil ls -b gs://$BUCKET_NAME || gsutil mb gs://$BUCKET_NAME Give permissions to Vertex AI to access your bucket Go to IAM tab in GCS console and assign Storage Admin role to your default Compute Engine. The principal of the default Compute Engine account looks like this: -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com. Download sample data We’ll use the Boston Housing dataset which can be obtained from Kaggle. Login to your Kaggle account. In the top right corner click on your user icon and select Account. Find API section and click on Create New API Token. This will produce kaggle.json file. Open kaggle.json and copy the username and key. Substitute the values in the cell and run it: %env KAGGLE_USERNAME= %env KAGGLE_KEY= !kaggle datasets download -f housing.csv vikrishnan/boston-house-prices Load training data to Vantage Let’s setup DATABASE_URL environment variable that will point to your instance of Vantage. Make sure that you default to mldb database where BYOM package is installed, e.g.: DATABASE_URL='teradatasql://dbc:dbc@34.121.78.209/mldb' %env DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL import pandas import os df=pandas.read_fwf('housing.csv', names=['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV']) df.to_sql('housing', con=DATABASE_URL, index=False) For this tutiorial we need a table to store the trained model and another table with some new data that we want to score with our model. Use teradatasql to execute the following SQL on your Vantage instance. %%sql CREATE SET TABLE demo_models (model_id VARCHAR (30), model BLOB) PRIMARY INDEX (model_id); CREATE SET TABLE test_housing (ID INTEGER, CRIM FLOAT, ZN FLOAT,INDUS FLOAT,CHAS INTEGER,NOX FLOAT,RM FLOAT, AGE FLOAT,DIS FLOAT, RAD INTEGER,TAX INTEGER,PTRATIO FLOAT,B FLOAT,LSTAT FLOAT) PRIMARY INDEX (CRIM); INSERT INTO test_housing (ID, CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT) VALUES (1,.02,0.0,7.07,0,.46,6.4,78.9,4.9,2,242,17.8,396.9,9.14); Now we are ready to create the components in the pipeline. Vertex AI Pipelines can run pipelines built using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK or TensorFlow Extended. We’ll be using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK for this simple example using scikit-learn. In this example we will create the following three components: read_data_from_vantage input: ipaddr of the VM hosting Vantage output: csv file with the data for training and testing train_model input: csv file with data for training and testing output: file containing the model output: Metric artifact with model performance deploy_model input: file containing the model First, import the Kubeflow Pipeline component and dsl packages. import kfp.v2.dsl as dsl from kfp.v2.dsl import ( component, Input, Output, Dataset, Model, Metrics, ) The first component reads data from a Vantage warehouse (see above and make sure you have set up Vantage Express in Google Cloud including opening up a firewall to the VM so you can access Vantage from the Internet.) The component connects to Vantage using the connection string passed as an input parameter, reads the rows from the table mldb.housing in Vantage and then outputs the data to an Output[Dataset]. The Output is a temporary file used to pass data between components (see more about passing data between components here). The component uses sqlalchemy to talk to Teradata. Each component is run in a separate container on Kubernetes so all import statements need to be done within the component. We have created a base image with teradatasql already installed. When you pass base_image='python' the component will use that image to create a container. packages_to_install parameter defines what other packages the component needs. @component(base_image='python', packages_to_install=['teradatasqlalchemy']) def read_data_from_vantage( connection_string: str, output_file: Output[Dataset] ): import sqlalchemy file_name = output_file.path engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) with engine.connect() as con: rs = con.execute('SELECT * FROM housing') with open(output_file.path, 'w') as output_file: output_file.write('CRIM,ZN,INDUS,CHAS,NOX,RM,AGE,DIS,RAD,TAX,PTRATIO,B,LSTAT,MEDV\\n') for row in rs: output_file.write(','.join([str(i) for i in row]) + '\\n') Next we’ll create a component to train a model with the training data. The input into this component is the file from the previous component. The output is the file with the trained model using joblib.dump and a file with the test data. The component will use scikit-learn and pandas so we need to pass packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn'] - this will tell Kubeflow to install the packages when the container is created. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml', packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn','sklearn-pandas==1.5.0']) def train_model( input_file : Input[Dataset], output_model: Output[Model], output_metrics: Output[Metrics] ): import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn import metrics from sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper import joblib from sklearn2pmml.pipeline import PMMLPipeline from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml df = pd.read_csv(input_file.path) train, test = train_test_split(df, test_size = .33) train = train.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore') test = test.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore') target = 'MEDV' features = train.columns.drop(target) pipeline = PMMLPipeline([ (\"mapping\", DataFrameMapper([ (['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT'], StandardScaler()) ])), (\"rfc\", RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators = 100, random_state = 0)) ]) pipeline.fit(train[features], train[target]) y_pred = pipeline.predict(test[features]) metric_accuracy = metrics.mean_squared_error(y_pred,test[target]) output_metrics.log_metric('accuracy', metric_accuracy) output_model.metadata['accuracy'] = metric_accuracy joblib.dump(pipeline, output_model.path) The last component loads the model and tests it on the test data. The Output[Metrics] creates an artifact with the models performance and can be visualize in the Runtime Graph. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml') def deploy_model( connection_string: str, input_model : Input[Model], ): import sqlalchemy import teradataml as tdml import joblib from sklearn2pmml.pipeline import PMMLPipeline from sklearn2pmml import sklearn2pmml engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) tdml.create_context(tdsqlengine = engine) pipeline = joblib.load(input_model.path) sklearn2pmml(pipeline, \"test_local.pmml\", with_repr = True) model_id = 'housing_rf' model_file = 'test_local.pmml' table_name = 'demo_models' tdml.configure.byom_install_location = \"mldb\" try: res = tdml.save_byom(model_id = model_id, model_file = model_file, table_name = table_name) except Exception as e: # if our model exists, delete and rewrite if str(e.args).find('TDML_2200') >= 1: res = tdml.delete_byom(model_id = model_id, table_name = table_name) res = tdml.save_byom(model_id = model_id, model_file = model_file, table_name = table_name) pass else: raise Now we’ll create a function to execute each component in the pipeline. @dsl.pipeline( name='run-vantage-pipeline', description='An example pipeline that connects to Vantage.', ) def run_vantage_pipeline_vertex( connection_string: str ): data_file = read_data_from_vantage(connection_string).output test_model_data = train_model(data_file) deploy_model(connection_string,test_model_data.outputs['output_model']) Compile the pipeline. The pipline will be saved in a json file with the name provided as the package_path. from kfp.v2 import compiler compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=run_vantage_pipeline_vertex, package_path='train_housing_pipeline.json') Now use the Vertex AI client to execute the pipeline. Import the google.cloud.aiplatform package. Vertex AI needs a Cloud Storage bucket to for temporary files. Create a new job using the json file above and pass the ipaddr as the parameter. Then submit the job. When the job starts a link will appear that will take you to the Runtime Graph. import google.cloud.aiplatform as aip pipeline_root_path = 'gs://' + BUCKET_NAME job = aip.PipelineJob( display_name=\"housing_training_deploy\", template_path=\"train_housing_pipeline.json\", pipeline_root=pipeline_root_path, parameter_values={ 'connection_string': DATABASE_URL } ) job.submit() When the pipeline has completed running (each component in the graph should have a green check mark). You can click on each component to see details of the execution and the logs created. If you click on the output_metrics artifact, in the Pipeline run analysis window the Node Info will show the accuracy of the model. Yyou can learn more about other metrics you can pass and visulation using the Metrics artifict here.) Let’s test the model we have just deployed by scoring some new data. We’ll use the teradataml driver to retrieve the saved model and score the rows in a table with new data. import teradataml as tdml import sqlalchemy import os engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL) eng = tdml.create_context(tdsqlengine = engine) #indicate the database that BYOM is using tdml.configure.byom_install_location = \"mldb\" tdf_test = tdml.DataFrame('test_housing') modeldata = tdml.retrieve_byom(\"housing_rf\", table_name=\"demo_models\") predictions = tdml.PMMLPredict( modeldata = modeldata, newdata = tdf_test, accumulate = ['ID'] ) predictions.result.to_pandas() This pipeline will have only one component that uses the teradatasql driver to execute a SQL query that retrieves the model from the demo_model table and scores the rows in the test_housing table. @component(base_image='teradata/python-sklearn2pmml', packages_to_install=['pandas==1.3.5','scikit-learn']) def score_new_data( connection_string: str, model_name: str, model_table: str, data_table: str, prediction_table: str ): import teradataml as tdml import sqlalchemy engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_string) with engine.connect() as con: con.execute(f'CREATE TABLE {prediction_table} AS (SELECT * FROM mldb.PMMLPredict ( ON {data_table} ON (SELECT * FROM {model_table} where model_id=\\'{model_name}\\') DIMENSION USING Accumulate (\\'ID\\')) AS td ) WITH DATA') The run_new_data_score pipeline takes the following parameters: model_name: ID of the model model_table: the name of the table storing the model data_table: the name of the table with new data to score prediction_table: the name of the table to store the scoring results When the pipeline is executed the dashboard will provide fields to enter the values you want to use. @dsl.pipeline( name='new-data-pipeline', description='An example of a component that scores new data with a saved model.', ) def run_new_data_score( connection_string: str, model_name: str, model_table: str, data_table: str, prediction_table: str ): score_new_data(DATABASE_URL,model_name,model_table,data_table,prediction_table) To compile the pipeline run the following code. The pipeline will be saved in score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json file. compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=run_new_data_score, package_path='score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json') We will now execute the pipeline in Vertex AI Pipelines. import google.cloud.aiplatform as aip pipeline_root_path = 'gs://' + BUCKET_NAME job = aip.PipelineJob( display_name=\"new_data_housing\", template_path=\"score_new_data_pipeline_sql.json\", pipeline_root=pipeline_root_path, parameter_values={ 'connection_string': DATABASE_URL, 'model_name': 'housing_rf', 'model_table': 'demo_models', 'data_table': 'test_housing', 'prediction_table': 'housing_predictions' } ) job.submit() Once the job completes, you can view the batch predictions with: %%sql SELECT * FROM housing_predictions; To stop incurring charges you need to clean up the following resources: Delete the Vantage Express VM - go to the list of Compute Engine instances and selecting the instance with Vantage Express and then click on Delete.
